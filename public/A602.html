is considered to be a hard problem. However, it is actually quite easy. By the
definition given, the function @ merely cubes the term on the left and then
subtracts 1 from it (the value of the term on the right is irrelevant). In each
column, the term on the left is <em>x</em>. <br>Hence, in each case,
the result is <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> &ndash; 1. This shows the two expressions
are equal, and <strong>the answer is (C).</strong></p>
