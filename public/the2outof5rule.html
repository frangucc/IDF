	<h1>The "2 out of 5" Rule</h1>

<p>It is significantly harder to create a good but incorrect
answer-choice than it is to produce the correct answer. For this reason usually
only two attractive answer-choices are offered. One correct; the other either
intentionally misleading or only partially correct. The other three
answer-choices are usually fluff. This makes educated guessing on the GRE
immensely effective. If you can dismiss the three fluff choices, your
probability of answering the question successfully will increase from 20% to
50%.</p>
