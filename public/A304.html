class="solution">Solution:</span></u>Since b is the <em>y</em>-coordinate
of a point in Quadrant II, it is positive. Since a is the <em>y</em>-coordinate
of a point in Quadrant IV, it is negative and therefore &ndash;3a is
positive. <br>Hence, both columns are positive. However, since the point (&ndash;3,
b) could be anywhere in Quadrant II and the point (3, a) could be anywhere in
Quadrant IV, we cannot deduce anything more about the relative sizes of &ndash;3a
and 3b. <strong>The answer is D</strong>.</p>
