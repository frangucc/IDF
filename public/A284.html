class="solution">Solution:</span>The shortest distance between two
points is along the line joining them. So, the lengths of the arcs <EM>PQ</EM>,
<EM>QR</EM>, <EM>RS</EM>, and <EM>SP</EM>
are greater than the lengths of the sides <EM>PQ</EM>, <EM>QR</EM>,
<EM>RS</EM>, and <EM>SP</EM>, respectively. The circum ference
of the circle is the sum of lengths of the arcs <EM>PQ</EM>, <EM>QR</EM>,
<EM>RS</EM>, and <EM>SP</EM>, and the perimeter of the
square is the sum of the sides <EM>PQ</EM>, <EM>QR</EM>,
<EM>RS</EM>, and <EM>SP</EM>. Since each arc is greater
than the corresponding side, the circum ference of the circle must be greater
than the perimeter of the square. <br>Hence, <strong>the answer is
A</strong>.</p>
