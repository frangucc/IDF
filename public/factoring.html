	<h1>Factoring</h1>

<p>To factor an algebraic expression is to rewrite it as a
product of two or more expressions, called factors. In general, any expression
on the GRE that can be factored should be factored, and any expression that can
be unfactored (multiplied out) should be unfactored.</p>
