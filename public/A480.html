than the total profit in 1990?</div><div class="options"><ol id="list3"><li><p>

class="solution">Solution:</span>Remember,
rarely does a graph question involve significant computation. For this
question, we need merely to read the bar graph. The Total Profit graph shows
that in 1993 approximately 680 thousand was earned, and in 1990 approximately
560 thousand was earned. Subtracting these numbers yields </p>

<p>680 &ndash; 560 = 120
<br><strong>The answer is (C).</strong></p>
