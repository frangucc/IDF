	<h1>Etymology</h1></p>



<p><em>Etymology</em> is the study of the
development of words and their forms. Many of the words in the English language
have fascinating histories; familiarity with these stories and the development
of the words can help you remember the meanings of the words and help you
decipher the meanings of others words.</p>
