	<h1>Sample Arguments & Essays</h1></p>

<p>Following is an example of an <em>Analyze an
Argument</em> essay. Let&rsquo;s complete each of the five steps to
illustrate the process.</p>

<p><strong>Argument:</strong></p>

<p>The following appeared in a memo from a human
resources manager at Presto Products.</p>

<p>"Over the past
year, we have had 25 percent more on-the-job accidents than Mega Manufacturing,
which is just down the street. Mega Manufacturing&rsquo;s employees begin
work at 9:00 instead of 8:00, like Presto Products, and they end at 5:30 just
like we do. This means that their employees work one hour less than our
employees do. We should adopt the same working hours as Mega Manufacturing so
our employees are more rested. This would decrease the number of on-the-job
accidents since it would take away the fatigue factor."</p>

<p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong> &ndash; Understanding the Argument</p>

<ul><li>Identify the conclusion. <em>Presto
has had more on-the-job accidents than Mega, and the HR manager feels this is
caused by fatigue since Presto employees work one hour longer than Mega
employees.</em></li>
<li> What premises does the author offer to
support the conclusion? <em>Mega employees begin work later and have
fewer on-the-job accidents.</em></li>
<li> What fallacies or flaws do you recognize
in the argument? <em>The author makes a hasty generalization, comparing
the two companies as if they are identical.</em></li>
<li>What assumptions are made in the argument?
<em>That fatigue is the main factor in accidents. Also that
Presto&rsquo;s employees are suffering from fatigue just because of one
extra hour of work. Also assumes that break times at both companies are the
same.</em></li>
<li>What does the argument fail to address? <em>What
each company does. (Maybe one company&rsquo;s employees spend more time
working with hazardous equipment.)</em></li>
<li> What necessary evidence is omitted from
the argument? <em>What each company does. Also, the size of each company
&ndash; size both of the actual building and of the number of employees
(more people in a smaller space could lead to more accidents).</em></li></ul>

<p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong> &ndash; Developing My Thesis</p>

<p>The argument that <u>Presto&rsquo;s occurrences of
on-the-job accidents would be less if the employees worked an hour
less</u> creates several problems because 1) it assumes that <u>fatigue
is the main factor in on-the-job accidents and that breaks are the same at both
companies</u>, 2) it fails to address <u>what each company
does</u>, 3) it omits the following important evidence: <u>What the
companies do and the size of the companies</u>.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong> &ndash; Organizing My Thoughts</p>

<p>ANALYZING AN ARGUMENT ESSAY FORMULA <em>(formula 2)</em>:</p>

<p>I. Introduction</p>

<ol style="list-style:upper-alpha"><li> A memo recently went out to Presto employees regarding
on-the-job accidents. It seems that Presto&rsquo;s rate of accidents is 25
percent higher than that of nearby Mega Manufacturing. The memo suggested that
Presto employees&rsquo; workdays should be shortened by one hour by
starting work at 9:00 instead of 8:00.</li>
<li> The argument that Presto&rsquo;s occurrences of
on-the-job accidents would be less if the employees worked an hour less creates
several problems because it assumes fatigue is the main factor in the
accidents, it fails to address what each company does, and it does not discuss
the size of the companies.</li></ol>

<p>V. Conclusion</p>

<ol style="list-style:upper-alpha"><li>Restate thesis</li><li> Presto should examine other elements in the location
where the majority of the accidents occur. Such things as machinery, workspace
and employee experience may be important factors to consider.</li></ol>

<p><strong><strong>Step 4</strong></strong> &ndash; Writing My Essay</p>

<p>On-the-job accidents are a major concern to
companies. Every year, workplace injuries cost companies thousands of dollars
in medical expenses and wages paid to recovering employees. Naturally, these
companies look for ways to reduce risks and make the workplace safer. Recently,
a memo went out to Presto Product employees regarding on-the-job accidents. It
seems that Presto&rsquo;s rate of accidents is 25 percent higher than that
of nearby Mega Manufacturing. The memo suggested that Presto employees&rsquo;
workdays should be shortened by one hour by starting work at 9:00 instead of
8:00. However, this argument has several flaws: Based on an assumption that
Presto employees work more hours than Mega Manufacturing, it offers fatigue as
the main factor in these accidents, and it does not discuss the size of the
companies or describe what each company does.</p>

<p>By not taking into account what each company does, the
Presto memo fails to accurately identify the cause of on-the-job accidents. For
example, perhaps Presto Products uses forklifts and Mega Manufacturing does
not. If this were the case, Presto could have a higher rate of accidents
involving those workers who operate the heavy machinery. In addition, the type
of work Presto employees do could be more of a contributing factor to fatigue
than the number of hours worked. If workers at Presto Products spend a majority
of the day on their feet, they would clearly be more affected by fatigue than a
company whose employees spend much of their time at desks.</p>

<p>In addition to the misguided assumptions the Presto memo
makes about fatigue, it also fails to consider break times during a workday. By
law, companies are required to give their employees a certain number of timed
breaks. The number of breaks required is dependent upon the number of hours an
employee is required to work. Therefore, it is possible that at Mega
Manufacturing employees get fewer breaks than Presto employees do. Moreover,
perhaps lunch time at Mega Manufacturing is shorter than at Presto. Over the
course of a day, then, Presto employees may work the same number of hours as
the workers at Mega Manufacturing.</p>

<p>Besides failing to consider break times during the workday,
the Presto memo also omits important information. The memo should address
various concrete factors such as the size of the Presto&rsquo;s building
and the number of employees working there. By comparing this information to the
same type of information from Mega Manufacturing, it may be possible to draw an
accurate comparison. For example, perhaps Presto&rsquo;s staff has outgrown
their facility while Mega Manufacturing&rsquo;s small staff enjoys the
luxury of private offices and a large spacious warehouse. For Presto, a crowded
building could become a hazard.</p>

<p>There are many potential hazards at the workplace. A company
like Presto cannot validly assume that fatigue is the main cause of on-the-job
accidents without supplying solid evidence to support such a finding. If they
wish to prove that fatigue is the primary cause of on-the-job accidents, they
must rule out other potential causes. Discussing other potentially hazardous
factors with their employees would also go a long way toward finding a
solution.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Step 5</strong></strong> &ndash; Revising My Essay</p>

<p>Just like in <em>Present Your
Perspective on an Issue</em>, here is your chance to revise an essay.
Answer the following questions regarding the essay above.</p>

<ul><li>Is the introduction
captivating? Why or why not? Do you recognize a certain method the author
employs to make the introduction interesting?</li>
<li> Is the thesis statement
concise? Does it clearly show the purpose of the essay?</li>
<li> Do the body paragraphs
clearly support each point made in the thesis? If not, where does the essay
lack necessary support?</li>
<li> Are there logical
transitions that make the text flow smoothly between sentences and between
paragraphs? Underline each word, phrase or sentence that acts as a transition.</li>
<li> Is the tone and diction
consistent throughout the essay? If not, point out the places where consistency
breaks down.</li>
<li> Is the use of person
consistent? If not, point out the places where consistency is not maintained.</li>
<li> Is there a word, or are
there words, which have been used too often in the essay? List these words.
Also list the words that have been used to provide variety in the essay.</li>
<li>Do the sentences vary in
length and structure?</li></ul>
