</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect because the plural pronoun <em>their</em> cannot
have the singular noun <em>a manufacturer</em> as its antecedent.</p>

<p>Although choice (B) corrects the given false reference, it
introduces another one. <em>Their</em> can now refer to either <em>customers</em>
or <em>government</em>, neither of which would make sense in this
context.</p>

<p>Choice (C) also corrects the false reference, but it
introduces a redundancy: <em>immediately</em> means  without delay."</p>

<p>Choice (D) corrects the false reference, but its structure
is very awkward. The direct object of a verb should be as close to the verb as
possible. In this case, the verb <em>notify</em> is separated from
its direct object <em>customers</em> by the clause <em> that
the government is contemplating a forced recall of any of the manufacturer&rsquo;s
products that."</em></p>

<p>Choice (E) is correct because the singular pronoun <em>its</em>
has the singular noun <em>a manufacturer</em> as its antecedent. <strong>The
answer is (E).</p>
