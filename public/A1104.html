	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>Although World War II ended
nearly a half century ago, Russia and Japan still <u>have not signed a formal
peace treaty; and both countries have been</u> reticent to develop closer
relations.</div><div class="options"><ol

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>The
sentence is grammatical as written. The present perfect verb <em>have  
signed</em> correctly indicates that they have not signed a peace treaty
and are not on the verge of signing one. Further, the present perfect verb <em>have</em>
<em>been</em> correctly indicates that in the past both countries
have been reluctant to develop closer relations and are still reluctant. <strong>The
answer is (A).</strong></p>

<p>In choice (B), the simple past <em>did</em> does
not capture the fact that they did not sign a peace treaty immediately after
the war and still have not signed one.</p>

<p>Choice (C) is very awkward, and the present progressive <em>being</em>
does not capture the fact that the countries have been reluctant to thaw
relations since after the war up through the present.</p>

<p>In choice (D), the present tense <em>are</em>
leaves open the possibility that in the past the countries may have desired
closer relations but now no longer do.</p>

<p>In choice (E), the present progressive tense <em>are  
signing</em>, as in choice (D), leaves open the possibility that in the
past the countries may have desired closer relations but now no longer do.<strong></p>
