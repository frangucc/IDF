	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>In the 1950&rsquo;s,
integration was an anathema <u>to most Americans; now, however, most Americans
accept it as desirable.</u></div><div class="options"><ol

most Americans, now, however, most Americans accept it.</p></li><li><p>to
most Americans; now, however, most Americans are desirable of it.</p></li><li><p>to
most Americans; now, however, most Americans accepted it as desirable.</p></li><li><p>to
most Americans. Now, however, most Americans will accept it as desirable.</p>

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>The
sentence is not incorrect as written. <br>Hence, <strong>the answer is choice
(A).</strong></p>

<p>Choice (B) creates a run-on sentence by replacing the
semicolon with a comma. Without a connecting word&mdash;<em>and, or,
but</em>, etc.&mdash;two independent clauses must be joined by a
semicolon or written as two separate sentences. Also, deleting <em> as
desirable"</em> changes the meaning of the
sentence.</p>

<p>Choice (C) uses a very awkward construction:<em> are
desirable of it</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (D) contains an error in tense. The sentence
progresses from the past to the present, so the verb in the second clause
should be <em>accept</em>, not <em>accepted</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (E) writes the two clauses as separate sentences,
which is allowable, but it also changes the tense of the second clause to the
future: <em>will accept</em>.<strong></p>
