	<h1>Introduction</h1></p>

<p>The Analytical Writing Section requires you to respond to
two essay questions within 75 minutes. The first section, <em>Present
Your Perspective on an Issue</em> (45 minutes), asks that you discuss the
complexities of an issue and take a position on the problem. The second
section, <em>Analyze an Argument</em> (30 minutes), asks that you
evaluate an argument or critique a line of reasoning. You are not required to
agree or disagree with the argument, but you must clearly point out the
strengths and weaknesses in the argument.</p>

<p>ETS has an official Web site, www.gre.org, where you can
view the pool of topic questions from which the questions on your test will be
randomly drawn. It is helpful to review this list of questions, but do not try
to write a sample essay for each topic because the list of topics is much too
extensive. Moreover, the wording of the question on the test may be altered, so
it is best just to become familiar with the kind of topics and arguments you
will be required to address. The more familiar you are with the material that
will be on the test, the more prepared and confident you&rsquo;ll be on
test day.</p>

<p>You will type your essay on a computer using a very basic
word processor. The Analytical Writing Section starts with a tutorial that
shows how the word processor works. You may write your essay on the computer or
on paper supplied at the center. However, handwritten essays can take up to six
weeks to be scored. After<strong> </strong>completing the Issue
section, you may move on to the Argument section. There is no break between
sections, and, once you exit either section, you cannot return, even if you
finish with time remaining.</p>
