	<h1>Colons</h1>
	<p>Use a colon:</p>

<ol><li>(Rule 1) to introduce an explanation or
example.</li><li>(Rule 2) to introduce a series, list, or quotation.</li></ol><strong>Rule
1:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a colon to relate two independent clauses
when introducing an explanation or example.</p>

<p>When a comma does not place adequate emphasis
on the relationship between two independent clauses, you can use a semicolon.
When a semicolon does not provide adequate emphasis, you can use a colon. A
colon joins two independent clauses to emphasize the relationship between the
two clauses and is often used to introduce an explanation or an example.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>When I picture my dream house, it is set in
beautiful scenery: the beach or mountains, for example, would provide an ideal
setting for a home.</p>

<p>In this sentence, the colon serves to
introduce two examples of a dream home. The colon in this example strengthens
the relationship between the idea of a beach or mountain home and the subject
of dream homes in the first clause. A colon can also introduce an explanation
such as in the following example:</p>

<p>Dave and Stephanie&rsquo;s presentation
lacked the usual enthusiasm: this could be because they were at the office all
night working on the ad campaign.</p>

<p>The second clause in this example explains
the first clause and therefore may be introduced with a colon.</p>

<p>Just as with semicolons, the choice to use colons can be a
stylistic one. If you do choose to use a colon to introduce an explanation or
example, make sure that both the preceding clause and the clause that follows
are independent clauses.</p>

<p>Capitalize the clause that follows a colon if
it is a formal statement or if the content that is introduced contains more
than one sentence.</p>

<p>Example (formal statement):</p>

<p>Our club bylaws shall set forth the
following: Rules for meetings, code of conduct, and membership procedures.</p>

<p>Example (more than one clause):</p>

<p>When thinking of a future career, there are
many choices: Becoming a lawyer would be a good financial decision. On the
other hand, teaching may provide more personal satisfaction.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a colon after an independent
clause to introduce a series, list, or quotation.</p>

<p>Use a colon to introduce a series or list
such as in the following examples:</p>

<p>We need to get several things done before our
trip: pay the bills, water the plants, and take the dog to the kennel.</p>

<p>Before we can take off, you must do the
following: fasten your seat belt, turn off your cell phone, and return your
tray table to its upright position.</p>

<p>The names of the people who made the
volleyball team are as follows: Ruth, Mary Lynn, Amy, Sarah, Alicia, and
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Note that when the word <em>following</em>
or <em>follows</em> is used to introduce a list or series you must
use a colon. You should also use a colon to introduce a quotation.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
As people seek to build relationships and, in
so doing, break down the walls of racism, they should remember Martin Luther
King, Jr.&rsquo;s famous words: "I have a dream
that [we] will one day live in a nation where [we] will not be judged by the
color of [our] skin but by the content of [our] character."</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>Use a colon to introduce a series or list. Always
use a colon if the clause that introduces the list or series contains the term <em>follows
</em>or <em>following</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
The following improvements need to be made to
your house before you try to sell it: new carpet should be installed, the
outside trim should be painted, and the fixtures in the downstairs bathroom
should be replaced.</p>

<p>Do not use a colon if the list or series is
introduced by phrases such as <em>especially</em>, <em>such
as</em>, <em>namely</em>, <em>for instance</em>, <em>for
example</em>, or <em>that is</em> unless the series is made
up of one or more independent clauses.</p>

<p>Incorrect (colon introducing a series of phrases):</p>

<p>Some of my life goals, for example: to ski in
the Alps, bungee jump from Victoria Falls, and visit the Great Wall of China.</p>

<p>Correct (colon introducing a series of independent clauses):</p>

<p>I have set some goals that I wish to achieve
before I get too old to do so. For example: I want to ski in the Alps, bungee
jump from Victoria Falls, and visit the Great Wall of China.</p>

<p>Note that a comma would work in this sentence
as well. The colon following <em>For example</em> places more
emphasis on the text that follows.</p>

<p>Do not use a colon to introduce a series that
is the object of the verb in the sentence. For example,</p>

<p>Incorrect:</p>

<p>After the maitre d&rsquo; seated us, I
ordered: French onion soup, a Caesar salad, and filet mignon.</p>

<p>Correct:</p>

<p>After the maitre d&rsquo; seated us, I
ordered French onion soup, a Caesar salad, and filet mignon.</p>

<p>You may use a colon to introduce a quotation
and, in this instance, you must capitalize the first word of the quotation.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
The principles of this country are founded on
the <em>Declaration of Independence </em>and its famous words: "We
hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these
are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."</p>
