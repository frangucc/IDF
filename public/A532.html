  <p>Together A and B can do a job in 6 hours, and together B and C can do the same job in 4 hours.</p>

class="solution">Solution:</span> We
are given that <EM>A</EM> takes 6 hours to do a job with <EM>B</EM>
and that <EM>C</EM> takes just 4 hours to do the same job with <EM>B</EM>.
Assuming that <EM>B</EM> works at the same rate when working with
either <EM>A</EM> or <EM>C</EM>, we conclude that <EM>C</EM>
works faster than <EM>A</EM>. <br>Hence, <EM>C</EM> does a
greater fraction of work per hour. <strong>The answer is
(B).</strong></p>
