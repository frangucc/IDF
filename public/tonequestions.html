	<h1>TONE QUESTIONS</h1>

<p>Tone questions ask you to identify the writer&rsquo;s
attitude or perspective. Is the writer&rsquo;s feeling toward the subject
positive, negative, or neutral? Does the writer give his own opinion, or does
he objectively present the opinions of others?</p>


<p>Before you read the answer-choices, decide
whether the writer&rsquo;s tone is positive, negative, or neutral. It is
best to do this without referring to the passage.</p>



<p>However, if you did not get a feel for the writer&rsquo;s
attitude on the first reading, check the adjectives that he chooses. Adjectives
and, to a lesser extent, adverbs express our feelings toward subjects. For
instance, if we agree with a person who holds strong feelings about a subject,
we may describe his opinions as impassioned. On the other hand, if we disagree
with him, we may describe his opinions as excitable, which has the same meaning
as "impassioned" but
carries a negative connotation.</p>
<p><strong>Read the passage slowly to get a good understanding of
the issues.</strong></p>

<p>There are two major systems of criminal
procedure in the modern world&mdash;the adversarial and the inquisitorial. The
former is associated with common law tradition and the latter with civil law
tradition. Both systems were historically preceded by the system of private
vengeance in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
administered it privately, either personally or through an agent. The vengeance
system was a system of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
slogan "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
The modern adversarial system is only one historical step removed from the
private vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic features.
Thus, for example, even though the right to institute criminal action has now
been extended to all members of society and even though the police department
has taken over the pretrial investigative functions on behalf of the
prosecution, the adversarial system still leaves the defendant to conduct his
own pretrial investigation. The trial is still viewed as a duel between two
adversaries, refereed by a judge who, at the beginning of the trial has no
knowledge of the investigative background of the case. In the final analysis
the adversarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the
punitive combat.</p>

<p>By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins historically
where the adversarial system stopped its development. It is two historical
steps removed from the system of private vengeance. Therefore, from the
standpoint of legal anthropology, it is historically superior to the
adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the public investigator has
the duty to investigate not just on behalf of the prosecutor but also on behalf
of the defendant. Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to present
to the court not only evidence that may lead to the conviction of the defendant
but also evidence that may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that
both parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence in their
possession. Finally, in an effort to make the trial less like a duel between
two adversaries, the inquisitorial system mandates that the judge take an
active part in the conduct of the trial, with a role that is both directive and
protective.</p>

<p>Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial system. This
system operates on the philosophical premise that in a criminal case the
crucial factor is not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the
goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the court the
commission of the alleged crime.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> (Refer to passage above.)<br>
The author&rsquo;s attitude toward the
adversarial system can best be described as </div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>encouraged
that it is far removed from the system of private vengeance</p></li><li><p>concerned
that it does not allow all members of society to instigate legal action</p></li><li><p>pleased
that it does not require the defendant to conduct his own pretrial
investigation</p></li><li><p>hopeful that it will be
replaced by the inquisitorial system</p></li><li><p>doubtful
that it is the best vehicle for justice</p>

</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
author does not reveal his feelings toward the adversarial system until the end
of paragraph one. Clearly the clause "the adversarial
system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the punitive combat"
indicates that he has a negative attitude toward the system. This is confirmed
in the second paragraph when he states that the inquisitorial system is
historically superior to the adversarial system. So he feels that the
adversarial system is deficient.</p>

<p>The "two-out-of-five"
rule is at work here: only choices (D) and (E) have any real merit. Both are
good answers. But which one is better? Intuitively, choice (E) is more likely
to be the answer because it is more measured. To decide between two choices
attack each: the one that survives is the answer. Now a tone question should be
answered from what is directly stated in the passage&mdash;not from what it
implies. Although the author has reservations toward the adversarial system, at
no point does he say that he hopes the inquisitorial system will replace it, he
may prefer a third system over both. This eliminates (D); <strong>the answer therefore
is (E)</strong>. </p>

<p>The remaining choices are not supported by the passage. (A),
using the same language as in the passage, overstates the author&rsquo;s
feeling. In lines 12&ndash;14, he states that the adversarial system is
only <em>one</em> step removed from the private vengeance system&mdash;not
<em>far</em> removed. Remember: Be wary of extreme words. (A) would
be a better choice if "far"
were dropped. (B) makes a false claim. In lines 15&ndash;17, the author
states that the adversarial system <em>does</em> extend the right
to initiate legal action to all members of society. Finally, (C) also makes a
false claim. In lines 20&ndash;21, the author states that the defendant in
the adversarial system is still left to conduct his own pretrial investigation.</p>



<p><strong>Application:
<em>(Mini-passage)</em></strong> </p>

<p>An elm in our backyard caught the blight this summer and
dropped stone dead, leafless, almost overnight. One weekend it was a
normal-looking elm, maybe a little bare in spots but nothing alarming, and the
next weekend it was gone, passed over, departed, taken....</p>

<p>The dying of a field mouse, at the jaws of an amiable
household cat, is a spectacle I have beheld many times. It used to make me
wince.... Nature, I thought, was an abomination.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve done some thinking about that mouse,
and I wonder if his dying is necessarily all that different from the passing of
our elm. The main difference, if there is one, would be in the matter of pain. I
do not believe that an elm tree has pain receptors, and even so, the blight
seems to me a relatively painless way to go. But the mouse dangling tail-down
from the teeth of a gray cat is something else again, with pain beyond bearing,
you&rsquo;d think, all over his small body. There are now some plausible
reasons for thinking it is not like that at all.... At the instant of being
trapped and penetrated by teeth, peptide hormones are released by cells in the
hypothalamus and the pituitary gland; instantly these substances, called
endorphins, are attached to the surfaces of other cells responsible for pain
perception; the hormones have the pharmacologic properties of opium; there is
no pain. Thus it is that the mouse seems always to dangle so languidly from the
jaws, lies there so quietly when dropped, dies of his injuries without a
struggle. If a mouse could shrug, he&rsquo;d shrug....</p>

<p>Pain is useful for avoidance, for getting away when there&rsquo;s
time to get away, but when it is end game, and no way back, pain is likely to
be turned off, and the mechanisms for this are wonderfully precise and quick. If
I had to design an ecosystem in which creatures had to live off each other and
in which dying was an indispensable part of living, I could not think of a
better way to manage.</p>

<p>From Lewis Thomas, <em>On Natural Death,</em>  
1979 by Lewis Thomas.</p>



<p>Which one of the following would best
characterize the author&rsquo;s attitude toward the relationship between
pain and death?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Dismay
at the inherent cruelty of nature</p></li><li><p>Amusement
at the irony of the relationship between pain and death</p></li><li><p>Admiration
for the ways in which animal life functions in the ecosystem</p></li><li><p>A
desire to conduct experiments on animals in order to discover more about the
relationship between pain and death</p>
</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
author&rsquo;s attitude toward the relationship between pain and death
evolves through three stages. First, he expresses revulsion at the
relationship. This is indicated in the second paragraph by the words <em>"wince"</em>
and <em>"abomination."</em>
Then in the third paragraph, he adopts a more analytical attitude and questions
his previous judgment. This is indicated by the clause, <em>"I
wonder if his dying is necessarily all that different from the passing of our
elm."</em> And in closing the paragraph, he
seems resigned to the fact the relationship is not all that bad. This is
indicated by the sentence, <em>"If a mouse
could shrug, he&rsquo;d shrug."</em> Finally,
in the last paragraph, he comes to express admiration for the relationship
between pain and death. This is indicated by the phrase <em>"<u>wonderfully</u>
precise and quick,"</em> and it is made
definite by the closing line, <em>"If I had
to design an ecosystem . . . in which dying was an indispensable part of
living, I could not think of a better way to
manage."</em> Thus, <strong>the answer is (C)</strong>.</p>

<p>The other choices are easily ruled out. Choice
(A) is perhaps superficially tempting. In the second paragraph the author does
express dismay at the ways of nature, but notice that his concerns are in the
past tense. He is <em>now</em> more understanding, wiser of the
ways of nature. As to (B), the author is subtly reverential, never ironical,
toward nature. Finally, (D) is not mentioned or alluded to in the passage.</p>

<p>Beware of answer-choices that contain extreme emotions. Remember
the passages are taken from academic journals. In the rarefied air of academic
circles, strong emotions are considered inappropriate and sophomoric. The
writers want to display opinions that are considered and reasonable, not
spontaneous and off-the-wall. So if an author&rsquo;s tone is negative, it
may be disapproving&mdash;not snide. Or if her tone is positive, it may be
approving&mdash;not ecstatic.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the answers must be indisputable. If the
answers were subjective, then the writers of the GRE would be deluged with
letters from angry test takers, complaining that their test-scores are unfair. To
avoid such a difficult position, the writers of the GRE never allow the correct
answer to be either controversial or grammatically questionable. </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use these theories to answer the following
questions.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Which one of the following most accurately
characterizes the author&rsquo;s attitude with respect to Phillis Wheatley&rsquo;s
literary accomplishments?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>enthusiastic
advocacy</p></li><li><p>qualified admiration</p></li><li><p>dispassionate
impartiality</p></li><li><p>detached ambivalence</p></li><li><p>perfunctory
dismissal</p>
</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Even
without reference to the passage, this is not a difficult question to answer.</p>

<p>Scholars may advocate each other&rsquo;s
work, but they are unlikely to be enthusiastic advocates. Furthermore, the
context stretches the meaning of advocacy&mdash;to defend someone else&rsquo;s
cause or plight. So (A) is unlikely to be the answer. </p><p>is
the measured response and therefore is probably the answer.</p>

<p>"Dispassionate impartiality"
is a rather odd construction; additionally, it is redundant. It could never be
the answer to a GRE question. This eliminates (C).</p>

<p>"Detached ambivalence"
is not as odd as "dispassionate impartiality,"
but it is unusual. So (D) is unlikely to be the answer.</p>

<p>Remember, scholars want their audience to consider their
opinions well thought out, not off-the-wall. But <em>perfunctory</em>
means "hasty and superficial."
So (E) could not be the answer. </p>

<p>Hence, even without the passage we can still find the
answer, <strong>(B)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Which one of the following best describes the
author&rsquo;s attitude toward scientific techniques?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>critical</p></li><li><p>hostile</p></li><li><p>idealistic</p></li><li><p>ironic</p></li><li><p>neutral</p>

</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>(A)
is one of two measured responses offered. Now a scholar may be critical of a
particular scientific technique, but only a crackpot would be critical of <em>all
</em>scientific techniques&mdash;eliminate (A).</p>

<p>"Hostile"
is far too negative. Scholars consider such emotions juvenile&mdash;eliminate
(B).</p>

<p>"Idealistic,"
on the other hand, is too positive; it sounds pollyannaish&mdash;eliminate
(C).</p>

<p>"Ironic"
seems illogical in this context. It&rsquo;s hard to conceive of a person
having an ironic attitude toward scientific techniques&mdash;eliminate (D). <strong>(E) </strong>is
the other measured response, and by elimination it is the answer.</p>
