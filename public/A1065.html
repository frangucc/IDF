class="solution">Solution:</span>The
conjunction "and" in
the phrase "Despite its _______ and safety"
indicates that the missing word has a positive meaning because "safety"
has a positive meaning. Since the sentence is implying that the drug is useful
in curing depression and anxiety, it is expected that the drug would be widely
used. But "despite"
implies that the drug is not widely "accepted."
<strong>The answer is (E).</strong></p>
