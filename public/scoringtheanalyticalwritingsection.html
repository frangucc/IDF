	<h1>Scoring the Analytical Writing Section</h1></p>

<p>Your Issue and Argument scores are combined into one average
score that is reported to the colleges. Although you can view your math and
verbal scores at the test center shortly after the test, your analytical
writing score will not be available until 10&ndash;15 days after the test.</p>

<p>Each of your two essays will be graded holistically,
receiving a score between 0 and 6. With the holistic grading method, papers are
read quickly and a score is assigned based on the general impact of the writing
on the reader. Papers awarded 6&rsquo;s are considered to be <em>outstanding</em>,
5&rsquo;s are<em> strong</em>, 4&rsquo;s are <em>adequate</em>,
3&rsquo;s are <em>limited</em>, 2&rsquo;s are <em>seriously
flawed</em>, and 1&rsquo;s are <em>fundamentally
deficient</em>. Notice that papers graded with "top-half"
scores&mdash;4, 5, or 6&mdash;are described as having positive
attributes, whereas papers receiving "bottom-half"
scores&mdash;1, 2, or 3&mdash;are described as being problematic.</p>

<p>Before we begin studying particular essays,
we need to review some fundamentals of sentence structure and punctuation. No
matter how inspired an essay is, its score may be hurt by punctuation errors
that make the essay difficult to read or inadvertently change its intended
meaning.</p>
