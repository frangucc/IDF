</div>
<div class="passage"><p>The premise with which the multiculturalists
begin is unexceptional: that it is important to recognize and to celebrate the
wide range of cultures that exist in the United States. In what sounds like a
reflection of traditional American pluralism, the multiculturalists argue that
we must recognize difference, that difference is legitimate; in its kindlier
versions, multiculturalism represents the discovery on the part of minority
groups that they can play a part in molding the larger culture even as they are
molded by it. And on the campus multiculturalism, defined more locally as the
need to recognize cultural variations among students, has tried with some
success to talk about how a racially and ethnically diverse student body can
enrich everyone&rsquo;s education.</p>

<p>Phillip Green, a political scientist at Smith and a
thoughtful proponent of multiculturalism, notes that for a significant portion
of the students the politics of identity is all-consuming. Students he says "are
unhappy with the thin gruel of rationalism. They require a therapeutic
curriculum to overcome not straightforward racism but ignorant stereotyping."</p>

<p><strong>(1) But</strong> multiculturalism&rsquo;s
hard-liners, who seem to make up the majority of the movement, damn as racism
any attempt to draw the myriad of American groups into a common American
culture. For these multiculturalists, differences are absolute, irreducible,
intractable&mdash;occasions not for understanding but for separation. The
multiculturalist, it turns out, is not especially interested in the great
American hyphen, in the syncretistic (and therefore naturally tolerant)
identities that allow Americans to belong to more than a single culture, to be
both particularists and universalists.</p>

<p>The time-honored American mixture of assimilation and
traditional allegiance is denounced as a danger to racial and gender
authenticity. This is an extraordinary reversal of the traditional liberal
commitment to a "truth"
that transcends parochialisms. In the new race/class/gender formation,
universality is replaced by, among other things, feminist science Nubian
numerals (as part of an Afro-centric science), and what Marilyn Frankenstein of
the University of Massachusetts-Boston describes as "ethno-mathematics,"
in which the cultural basis of counting comes to the fore.</p>

<p>The multiculturalists insist on seeing all perspectives as
tainted by the perceiver&rsquo;s particular point of view. Impartial
knowledge, they argue, is not possible, because ideas are simply the expression
of individual identity, or of the unspoken but inescapable assumptions that are
inscribed in a culture or a language. The problem, <strong>(2)
however,</strong> with this warmed-over Nietzscheanism is that it
threatens to leave no ground for anybody to stand on. So the multi-culturalists
make a leap, necessary for their own intellectual survival, and proceed to
argue that there are some categories, such as race and gender, that do in fact
embody an unmistakable knowledge of oppression. Victims are at least
epistemologically lucky. Objectivity is a mask for oppression. And so an
appalled former 1960s radical complained to me that self-proclaimed witches
were teaching classes on witchcraft. "They&rsquo;re
not teaching students how to think," she said, "they&rsquo;re
telling them what to believe."</p>

<p>Which one of the following ideas would a multiculturalist
NOT believe?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>That
we should recognize and celebrate the differences among the many cultures in
the United States.</p></li><li><p>That we can never
know the "truth"
because "truth" is
always shaped by one&rsquo;s culture.</p></li><li><p>That
"difference" is more
important than "sameness."</p></li><li><p>That
a school curriculum should be constructed to compensate for institutionalized
racism.</p></li><li><p>That different cultures should
work to assimilate themselves into the mainstream culture so that eventually
there will be no excuse for racism.</p></li></ol></div>
