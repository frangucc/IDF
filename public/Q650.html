</div>
<div class="passage">A growing taste for shark steaks and
shark-fin soup has for the first time in 400 million years put the scourge of
the sea at the wrong end of the food chain. Commercial landings of this
toothsome fish have doubled every year since 1986, and shark populations are
plunging. It is hardly a case of good riddance. Sharks do for gentler fish what
lions do for the wildebeest: they check populations by feeding on the weak. Also,
sharks apparently do not get cancer and may therefore harbor clues to the
nature of that disease.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the issue of motherhood. Sharks are
viviparous. That is, they bear their young alive and swimming (not sealed in
eggs) after gestation periods lasting from nine months to two years. Shark
mothers generally give birth to litters of from eight to twelve pups and bear
only one litter every other year.</p>

<p>This is why sharks have one of the lowest fecundity rates in
the ocean. The female cod, for example, spawns annually and lays a few million
eggs at a time. If three quarters of the cod were to be fished this year, they
could be back in full force in a few years. But if humans took that big of a
bite out of the sharks, the population would not recover for 15 years. </p>

<p>So, late this summer, if all goes according to plan, the
shark will join the bald eagle and the buffalo on the list of managed species. The
federal government will cap the U.S. commercial catch at 5,800 metric tons,
about half of the 1989 level, and limit sportsmen to two sharks per boat. Another
provision discourages finning, the harvesting of shark fins alone, by limiting
the weight of fins to 7 percent of that of all the carcasses.</p>

<p>Finning got under the skin of environmentalists, and the
resulting anger helped to mobilize support for the new regulations. Finning
itself is a fairly recent innovation. Shark fins contain noodle-like
cartilaginous tissues that Chinese chefs have traditionally used to thicken and
flavor soup. Over the past few years rising demand in Hong Kong has made the
fins as valuable as the rest of the fish. Long strands are prized, so unusually
large fins can be worth considerably more to the fisherman than the average
price of about $10 a pound. </p>

<p>But can U.S. quotas save shark species that wander the whole
Atlantic? The blue shark, for example, migrates into the waters of something
like 23 countries. John G. Casey, a biologist with the National Marine
Fisheries Service Research Center in Narragansett, R.I., admits that
international co-ordination will eventually be necessary. But he supports U.S.
quotas as a first step in mobilizing other nations. Meanwhile the commercial
fishermen are not waiting for the new rules to take effect. "There&rsquo;s
a pre-quota rush on sharks," Casey says, "and
it&rsquo;s going on as we speak."</p>An irony resulting from the announcement that
sharks will be placed on the managed list is</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>we
will now find out less about cancer, so in effect by saving the sharks, we are
hurting ourselves.</p></li><li><p>sharks are far more
dangerous to other fish than we are to them.</p></li><li><p>more
chefs are now using the cartilaginous tissues found in shark fins.</p></li><li><p>more
sharks are being killed now than before the announcement.</p></li><li><p>man
will now protect a creature that he has been the victim of.</p></li></ol></div>
