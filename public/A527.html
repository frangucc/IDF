class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>x</em> represent the number of students in the class who passed
the math exam. Since it is given that the number of students who passed the
math exam is half the number of students who passed the science exam, the
number of students in the class who passed the science exam is 2<em>x</em>.
It is given that 5 students passed both exams. <br>Hence, the number of students
who passed only the math exam is (<em>x</em> &ndash; 5), and
the number of students who passed only the science exam is (2<em>x</em>
&ndash; 5). Since it is given that each student in the class passed at
least one of the two exams, the number of students who failed both exams is 0.</p>

<p>We can divide the class into four groups:</p>

<p>1) Group of students who passed only the math exam: (<em>x</em>
&ndash; 5)</p>

<p>2) Group of students who passed only the science exam: (2<em>x</em>
&ndash; 5)</p>

<p>3) Group of students who passed both exams: 5</p>

<p>4) Group of students who failed both exams: 0</p>

<p>The sum of the number of students from each of these four
categories is equal to the number of students in the class&mdash;40.
Expressing this as an equation yields</p>

<p>(<em>x</em> &ndash; 5) + (2<em>x</em>
&ndash; 5) + 5 + 0 = 40</p>

<p>3<em>x</em> &ndash; 5 = 40</p>

<p>3<em>x</em> = 45</p>

<p><em>x</em> = 15</p>

<p>Thus, the number of students who passed the math exam is 15.
<strong>The answer is (C).</strong></p>
