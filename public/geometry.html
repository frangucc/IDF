	<h1>Geometry</h1>

<p>One-fourth of the math problems on the GRE involve geometry.
(There are no proofs.) Unfortunately, the figures on the GRE are usually not
drawn to scale. Hence, in most cases you cannot solve problems or check your
work by "eyeballing"
the drawing.</p>

<p>Following is a discussion of the basic properties of
geometry. You probably know many of these properties. Memorize any that you do
not know.</p>
