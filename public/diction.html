  <h1>Diction</h1>
  <p>While tone defines the overall language
you use, diction deals with the specific kinds of words and phrases you choose
for your essay. Since you have already determined your audience and thus
ascertained that you need to portray a formal tone in your essay, you must be
consistent with your diction, or word choice. Diction may be classified as
technical (<em>homo sapien</em> rather than <em>human</em>),
formal (<em>Please inform me when you are ready to depart.</em>),
informal or colloquial (<em>Give me a buzz when you&rsquo;re ready to
go.</em>), or slang (<em>She&rsquo;s a real couch potato and
watches the tube from early morning &rsquo;til the cows come
home.)</em> Knowing that your audience dictates a formal tone, you must
also be consistent in maintaining formal diction. Look at the following example
of inconsistent diction:</p>

<p>Violence in schools has become an epidemic
problem. School shootings occur regularly, and fights erupt daily in the nation&rsquo;s
classrooms. Even with the addition of metal detectors at school entrances,
violence will never be eradicated because the jocks are always ganging up on
the geeks. If only we could just all get along.</p>

<p>This example begins with a formal tone and
formal diction; however, it takes a quick turn when the writer uses slang words
like "jocks" and "geeks."
The paragraph is concluded informally with "If only
we could just all get along."</p>

<p>As you write your essay, and later when you
proofread it, you will want to make sure that you preserve the formality your
audience requires.</p>
