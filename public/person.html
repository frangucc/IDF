  <h1>Person </h1>
  <p>It is important to maintain
consistency in person. For example, if you begin your essay in second person (<em>you</em>)
do not shift to third person (<em>he</em>, <em>she</em>,
<em>it</em>, <em>one</em>, or <em>they</em>).
Let&rsquo;s look at a couple of examples illustrating a shift in person:</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong><u>One</u> can get excellent
grades in school if <u>you</u> study hard.</p>

<p>The switch from "one"
to "you" is confusing
and awkward. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Off the coast of Puerto Rico, on the island
of Vieques, is an old French mansion turned hotel. Here one can enjoy spacious
guest rooms and a cozy library. One can lounge around the pool and indulge in
the honorary pool bar. Because the hotel is not far from the ocean, you can
also take a leisurely walk down to the white sandy beach where one can spend a
lazy day basking in the sun.</p>

<p>The switch from <em>one</em> to <em>you</em>
is confusing in this paragraph and detracts from the imagery. Decide from the
beginning of your essay what person you wish to employ and make a conscious
effort to stick to it.</p>
