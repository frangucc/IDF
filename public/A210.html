class="solution">Solution:</span>We expect 4<em>x</em> to
have more prime factors than <em>x</em> since 4<em>x</em>
contains every factor of <em>x</em>. But as this is a hard problem,
we eliminate (A). 4<em>x</em> contains every factor of <em>x</em>,
so <em>x</em> cannot have more prime factors than 4<em>x</em>.
This eliminates (B). Now, <span class="equation">4<em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup><em>x</em></span>. But we are given that <em>x</em>
is even, so it already contains the prime factor 2. <br>Hence, the 4 does not add
any more distinct prime factors. So the columns are equal. <strong>The
answer is C</strong>.</p>
