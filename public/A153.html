class="solution">Solution: </span>In
the drawing, the area of region <EM>B</EM> does appear to equal the
area of region <EM>C</EM>. If each of the two cords passed through
the center of the circle, then the area of region <EM>B</EM> would
in fact equal the area of region <EM>C</EM>. But we are not told
that the cords pass through the center of the circle. There is not enough
information to answer the question, as the following drawing illustrates:</p>

<p><img width=127 height=128
src="qimage458.gif"></p>

<p>In this drawing, region A still has the same area as region <EM>D</EM>,
but clearly regions <EM>C</EM> and <EM>B</EM> have
different areas. <strong>The answer is (D).</strong></p>
