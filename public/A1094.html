</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect since it implies that <em>the other causes of
crime</em> are doing the focusing. </p>

<p>Choice (B) has the same flaw.</p>

<p>Choice (C) is incorrect. The phrase <em>by focusing on
poverty</em> must modify the subject of the sentence, but <em>there</em>
cannot be the subject since the construction <em>there are</em> is
used to introduce a subject.</p>

<p>Choice (D) implies that <em>crimes</em> are
focusing on poverty.</p>

<p>Choice (E) puts the subject of the sentence <em>sociologists</em>
immediately next to its modifying phrase <em>by focusing on
poverty</em>. <strong>The answer is (E).</p>
