	<h1>Sentence Fragments</h1>
	<p>A <em>sentence fragment</em> is a clause that is
punctuated like an independent clause, but it lacks a grammatical element
required to make it a complete sentence. As we discussed before, an independent
clause must have a subject and a verb. Without both a subject and a verb, a
clause is a sentence fragment because it cannot function alone.</p>

<p><strong>Example (independent clause):</strong><br>
<U>I</U> ran down the road.</p>

<p><strong>Examples (sentence fragments):</strong><br>
Ran down the road.</p>

<p>Running down the road.</p>

<p>The independent clause above has both a
subject (<EM>I</EM>) and a verb (<em>ran</em>). The
first example of a sentence fragment, however, has only a verb (<em>ran</em>).
The last example contains the participle <em>Running</em>, which
needs a helping verb like <em>was</em> as well as a subject like <em>He</em>:
<u>He</u> was running down the road.</p>

<p>To correct sentence fragments in your writing</p>

<p>- (<strong>Step 1</strong>) identify them.</p>

<p>-(<strong>Step 2</strong>) revise them.</p>

<p><u><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong></u> </p>

<p>&ndash; Identify sentence fragments in your writing.</p>

<p>To find sentence fragments in your writing, first analyze
each sentence. In your analysis, mark the subject and verb by underlining the
subject once and the verb twice. Following are some examples:</p>

<p>On our way to the store tomorrow, <u>we</u>
need to stop at the bank.</p>

<p>Sprinting toward the finish line, <u>Dan</u> took
a deep breath and pressed on.</p>

<p><u>Providing</u> equal opportunity to all
citizens is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>The first two examples begin with
introductory phrases, which can be confusing so take care in identifying these
types of clauses and isolating them from the independent clause. The third
example contains a gerund, <em>providing</em>, which acts as a
noun. Now let&rsquo;s analyze each sentence of a paragraph. First, we will
underline each subject and each verb. Then we will flag each sentence that is a
fragment with a star.</p>

<p><u>Dan</u> always has busy days
at his law office. *In the morning, stops for breakfast at a coffee shop near
the office. *Upon entering the office. <u>Dan</u> gets his messages
from his secretary. For the rest of the day <u>Dan</u> keeps busy.
*Reviewing briefs and preparing witnesses. Usually <u>Dan</u> does
not have time to go out to lunch, but his <u>secretary</u>
generally has something delivered to him. Dan&rsquo;s <u>afternoon</u>
progresses in much the same way as his morning. *When he gets home. <u>He</u>
is exhausted. *Because he is so tired. <u>He</u> goes to bed at
8:00.</p>

<p>Clearly, many of the sentences in this
paragraph need to be revised. Before we can complete the revisions, though, we
need to analyze what the problem is in each of the identified sentence
fragments. Let&rsquo;s look at each sentence:</p>

<p><u>Dan</u> always has busy days
at his law office. (This sentence is fine.)</p>

<p>*In the morning, stops for breakfast at a
coffee shop near the office. (The introductory phrase here can make the
sentence tricky because you may be tempted to identify <em>morning</em>
as the subject. Although <em>stops</em> is the verb, the subject is
missing.)</p>

<p>*Upon entering the office. (This introductory
phrase has been set off by itself.)</p>

<p><u>Dan</u> gets his messages from
his secretary. (This sentence is fine.)</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, <u>Dan</u>
keeps busy. (This sentence is fine, but again there is an introductory phrase,
which can be deceiving.)</p>

<p>*Reviewing briefs and preparing witnesses.
(This clause should act as the object of the sentence and therefore is missing
both the subject and the verb.)</p>

<p>Usually <u>Dan</u> does not have
time to go out to lunch, but his <u>secretary</u> generally has
something delivered to him. (Two independent clauses are correctly joined here
with a comma and a conjunction. In a sentence like this, identifying the
subject and verb can be confusing. In the second clause, for example, it would
be easy to mistake <em>his</em> as the subject when <em>his</em>
is actually an adjective modifying the subject <em>secretary</em>.)</p>

<p>Dan&rsquo;s <u>afternoon</u> progresses in
much the same way as his morning. (This sentence is fine, but again, <em>Dan&rsquo;s</em>
could be confused as the subject when <em>afternoon</em> is
actually the subject.)</p>

<p>*When he gets home. (The subject here is <em>he</em>,
and the verb is <em>gets</em>. However, the subordinator <em>when
</em>makes the sentence a dependent clause and it therefore cannot stand
alone as a sentence.)</p>

<p><u>He</u> is exhausted. (This
sentence is fine.)</p>

<p>*Because he is so tired. (The subject here is
<em>he</em>, and the verb is <em>is</em>. However, the
subordinator <em>because</em> makes the sentence a dependent clause
and it therefore cannot stand alone as a sentence.)</p>

<p><u>He</u> goes to bed at 8:00.
(This sentence is fine.)</p>



<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; After you have
identified the sentences that are fragments, you must revise them. There are
two ways to revise sentence fragments:</p>

<p>&bull; Combine sentences to make
them complete. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
(Fragments) Because I was at the office
working. I didn&rsquo;t make it to dinner.</p>

<p>(Revised) Because I was at the office
working, I didn&rsquo;t make it to dinner.</p>

<p>&bull; Add the necessary elements
to the fragment to make it complete. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
(Fragments) From the beginning. Wanted to
practice law in a small town.</p>

<p>(Revised) From the beginning, he wanted to
practice law in a small town.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s revise our example from
  Step 1:</p>

<p>Dan always has busy days at his law office.
In the morning, he stops for breakfast at a coffee shop near the office. Upon
entering the office, Dan gets his messages from his secretary. For the rest of
the day Dan keeps busy reviewing briefs and preparing witnesses. Usually Dan
does not have time to go out to lunch, but his secretary generally has
something delivered to him. Dan&rsquo;s afternoon progresses in much the
same way as his morning. When he gets home, he is exhausted. Because he is so
tired, he goes to bed at 8:00.</p>

<p>*In the morning, stops for breakfast at a
coffee shop near the office. (We corrected this sentence by adding the subject <em>he</em>
after the introductory phrase.)</p>

<p>*Upon entering the office. (We corrected this
sentence by replacing the period after <em>office</em> with a comma
and thereby making it an introductory phrase and combining it with the next
sentence.)</p>

<p>*Reviewing briefs and preparing witnesses. (We
corrected this fragment by simply combining it with the complete clause that
preceded it.)</p>

<p>*When he gets home. (We corrected this
sentence by replacing the period after <em>home</em> with a comma
and thereby making it an introductory phrase and combining it with the next
sentence.)</p>

<p>*Because he is so tired. (We corrected this
sentence by replacing the period after <em>tired</em> with a comma
and thereby making it an introductory phrase and combining it with the next
sentence.)</p>

<p>Once you have made your revisions, make sure
you reread your writing. Identify the subject and verb in each sentence once
again to make sure your revisions corrected the fragments.</p>
