class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>a</em> represent the age of the oldest person, <em>b</em>
the age of the age of second person, and <em>c</em> the age of
youngest person. The age of first person is twice the age of the second person
and three times the age of the third person. This can be expressed as <em>a</em>
= 2<em>b</em> and <em>a</em> = 3<em>c</em>.
Solving these equations for <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>
yields <em>b</em> = <em>a</em>/2 and <em>c</em>&nbsp;=
<em>a</em>/3. The sum of the ages of the three people is <span class="equation">

<em>a</em>
+ <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> = 33</span>. Substituting for <em>b</em>
and <em>c</em> in this equation, we get</p>

<p><em>a</em> + <em>a</em>/2 + <em>a</em>/3
= 33</p>

<p>6<em>a</em> + 3<em>a</em> + 2<em>a</em>
= 198 by multiplying both sides by 6</p>

<p>11<em>a</em> = 198</p>

<p><em>a</em> = 198/11 = 18 by dividing both sides
by 11</p>

<p>Since <em>c</em> = <em>a</em>/3, we
get</p>

<p><em>c</em> = <em>a</em>/3 = 18/3 = 6
<br><strong>The answer is (B).</strong></p>
