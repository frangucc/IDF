class="solution">Solution:</span> If
the parallelogram were a rectangle, then its area would be 15. The given
parallelogram can be viewed as a rectangle tilted 20 degrees. Now, did tilting
the rectangle make its area larger or smaller? It made it smaller. This can be
seen by looking at the extreme case&mdash;tilting the rectangle 80 degrees:</p>

<p>It is clear that the area decreases as the rectangle is
tilted. <br>Hence, the area of the given parallelogram is less than 15. <strong>The
answer is (B).</strong></p>
