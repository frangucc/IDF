	<h1>EXTENSION QUESTIONS</h1></p>

<p>Extension questions are the most common. They require you to
go beyond what is stated in the passage, asking you to draw an inference from
the passage, to make a conclusion based on the passage, or to identify one of
the author&rsquo;s tacit assumptions.</p>

<p>You may be asked to draw a conclusion based on the ideas or
facts presented:</p>

<li><p>It can be inferred from
the passage that . . .</p></li>

<li><p>The passage suggests
that . . .</p></li>

<p>Since extension questions require you to go beyond the
passage, the correct answer must say <em>more</em> than what is
said in the passage. Beware of same language traps with these questions: the
correct answer will often both paraphrase and extend a statement in the
passage, but it will not directly quote it.</p>


<p><strong>"Same
Language" traps: </strong>For extension
questions, any answer-choice that explicitly refers to or repeats a statement
in the passage will probably be wrong.</p>


<p>The correct answer to an extension question will not require
a quantum leap in thought, but it will add significantly to the ideas presented
in the passage.</p>
<p><strong>Read the passage slowly to get a good understanding of
the issues.</strong></p>

<p>There are two major systems of criminal
procedure in the modern world&mdash;the adversarial and the inquisitorial. The
former is associated with common law tradition and the latter with civil law
tradition. Both systems were historically preceded by the system of private
vengeance in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
administered it privately, either personally or through an agent. The vengeance
system was a system of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
slogan "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
The modern adversarial system is only one historical step removed from the
private vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic features.
Thus, for example, even though the right to institute criminal action has now
been extended to all members of society and even though the police department
has taken over the pretrial investigative functions on behalf of the
prosecution, the adversarial system still leaves the defendant to conduct his
own pretrial investigation. The trial is still viewed as a duel between two
adversaries, refereed by a judge who, at the beginning of the trial has no
knowledge of the investigative background of the case. In the final analysis
the adversarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the
punitive combat.</p>

<p>By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins historically
where the adversarial system stopped its development. It is two historical
steps removed from the system of private vengeance. Therefore, from the
standpoint of legal anthropology, it is historically superior to the
adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the public investigator has
the duty to investigate not just on behalf of the prosecutor but also on behalf
of the defendant. Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to present
to the court not only evidence that may lead to the conviction of the defendant
but also evidence that may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that
both parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence in their
possession. Finally, in an effort to make the trial less like a duel between
two adversaries, the inquisitorial system mandates that the judge take an
active part in the conduct of the trial, with a role that is both directive and
protective.</p>

<p>Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial system. This
system operates on the philosophical premise that in a criminal case the
crucial factor is not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the
goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the court the
commission of the alleged crime.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>(Refer to passage above.)<br>
The author views the prosecution&rsquo;s
role in the inquisitorial system as being</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>an
advocate for both society and the defendant</p></li><li><p>solely
responsible for starting a trial</p></li><li><p>a
protector of the legal rule</p></li><li><p>an
investigator only</p></li><li><p>an aggressive but fair
investigator</p>

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is an extension question. So the answer will not be explicitly stated in the
passage, but it will be strongly supported by it.</p>

<p>The author states that the prosecutor is duty
bound to present any evidence that may prove the defendant innocent and that he
must disclose all pretrial evidence (i.e., have no tricks up his sleeve). This
is the essence of fair play. So the answer is probably (E). </p>

<p>However, we should check all the choices. (A) overstates the
case. Although the prosecutor must disclose any evidence that might show the
defendant innocent, the prosecutor is still advocating society&rsquo;s case
against the defendant&mdash;it must merely be measured advocacy. This is
the second-best answer. As for (B), although it is implied that in both systems
the right to initiate a case is extended to all people through the prosecutor,
it is not stated or implied that this is the only way to start a case. Finally,
neither (C) nor (D) is mentioned or implied in the passage.<strong> The answer,
therefore, is (E).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Application:
<em>(Mini-passage)</em></strong> </p>

<p>Often, the central problem in any business is
that money is needed to make money. The following discusses the sale of equity,
which is one response to this problem.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sale of Capital
Stock</strong></em>: a way to obtain capital through the sale of
stock to individual investors beyond the scope of one&rsquo;s immediate
acquaintances. Periods of high interest rates turn entrepreneurs to this equity
market. This involves, of necessity, a dilution of ownership, and many owners
are reluctant to take this step for that reason. Whether the owner is wise in
declining to use outside equity financing depends upon the firm&rsquo;s
long-range prospects. If there is an opportunity for substantial expansion on a
continuing basis and if other sources are inadequate, the owner may decide
logically to bring in other owners. Owning part of a larger business may be
more profitable than owning all of a smaller business.</p>

<p><em>Small-Business Management</em>, 6th Ed.,  
1983 by South-Western Publishing Co.</p>

<p>The passage implies that an owner who chooses not to sell
capital stock despite the prospect of continued expansion is</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>subject
to increased regulation</p></li><li><p>more
conservative than is wise under the circumstances</p></li><li><p>likely
to have her ownership of the business diluted</p></li><li><p>sacrificing
security for rapid growth</p>

</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>(A):
No. This is not mentioned in the passage. <strong>(B):
Yes.</strong> The passage states that <em>"the
owner may decide <u>logically</u> to bring in other
owners";</em> in other words, the owner would
be wise to sell stock in this situation. (C): No. By NOT selling stock, the
owner retains full ownership. (D) No. Just the opposite: the owner would be
sacrificing a measure of security for growth if she did sell stock.</p>
