	<h1>Sentence Completions</h1>
<p>The sentence completions form the most straightforward part
of the test, and most students do well on them. You will get about 6 sentence
completions on the test.</p>

<p><strong>Before You Look at The Answer-Choices, Think
of a Word That "Fits"
The Sentence</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
Crestfallen by having done poorly on the GRE, Susan began to
question her abilities. Her self-confidence was <u> </u> .</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>appeased</p></li><li><p>destroyed</p></li><li><p>placated</p></li><li><p>elevated</p></li><li><p>sustained</p>

</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>If
somebody is crestfallen (despairing) and has begun to question herself, then
her self-confidence would be destroyed. Hence, <strong>the answer is
(B)</strong>.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>If a Sentence Has Two Blanks, Plug in the
First Word in Each Answer-Choice, Eliminating any that Don&rsquo;t Make
sense.</strong></p>

<p>After eliminating the answer-choices that don&rsquo;t
make sense with the first word plugged in, turn to the remaining answer-choices
and plug in the second word.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
The plane had been redesigned so many times before it
reached the assembly line that its <u> </u> conception was no
longer .</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>appropriate
. . visible</p></li><li><p>dilapidated . . relevant</p></li><li><p>original
. . recognizable</p></li><li><p>initial . .
understandable</p></li><li><p>promised . . viable</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>An
"appropriate conception"
does not make sense in this context, eliminate (A). A "dilapidated
conception" probably does not make sense in any
context, eliminate (B). A "promised conception"
is an odd construction, probably eliminate. Now, "original"
and "initial" both work
in the first blank. However, "understandable"
does not make sense in the second blank. A redesign could clarify the original
design, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how it would make the original
design unintelligible, eliminate (D). Finally, "recognizable"
<em>does</em> make sense. Since the plane was redesigned many
times, is it likely to look quite different from its original design. <strong>The
answer is (C)</strong>.<strong></strong></p>

<p>Most often the answer-choices to sentence completion
problems are not simple or common words, that is, words we use in daily speech.
Nevertheless, don&rsquo;t hesitate to use a common word. Although an
everyday word is unlikely to be the answer, it will help guide you to the
answer. Further, it will help eliminate wrong answer-choices.</p>

<p><strong>Be Alert to Transitional Words</strong></p>

<p>Transitional words tell you what is coming up. They indicate
that the author is now going to draw a contrast with something stated
previously, or support something stated previously.</p>

<p><strong>Contrast Indicators</strong></p>

<p>To contrast two things is to point out how they
differ. In this type of sentence completion problem, we look for a word that
has the opposite meaning (an antonym) of some key word or phrase in the
sentence. Following are some of the most common contrast indicators:</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
Although the warring parties had settled a number of
disputes, past experience made them<u> </u> to express optimism
that the talks would be a success.</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>rash

id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>"Although"
sets up a contrast between what has occurred&mdash;success on some issues&mdash;and
what can be expected to occur&mdash;success for the whole talks. Hence, the
parties are reluctant to express optimism. The common word "reluctant"
is not offered as an answer-choice, but a synonym&mdash;reticent&mdash;is.
<strong>The answer is (E)</strong>.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
Rather than increasing its security by developing nuclear
weapons, a nascent nuclear power is viewed as a by its enemies.</div><div

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
phrase "rather than"
sets up a contrast between what a country hopes to achieve by developing
nuclear weapons (increased security) and what it actually achieves (becoming a
target). <strong>The answer is (C)</strong>.<strong></strong></p>
