	<h1>Positive & Negative Numbers</h1>

<p></strong>A number greater than 0 is positive. On the
number line, positive numbers are to the right of 0. A number less than 0 is
negative. On the number line, negative numbers are to the left of 0. Zero is
the only number that is neither positive nor negative; it divides the two sets
of numbers. On the number line, numbers increase to the right and decrease to
the left.</p>

<p>The expression <em>x</em> > <em>y</em>
means that <em>x</em> is greater than <em>y</em>. In
other words, <em>x</em> is to the right of <em>y</em>
on the number line:</p>

<p>We usually have no trouble determining which of two numbers
is larger when both are positive or one is positive and the other negative
<span class="equation">(e.g., 5 > 2 and 3.1 > &ndash;2)</span>. However, we sometimes hesitate when
both numbers are negative <span class="equation">(e.g., &ndash;2 > &ndash;4.5)</span>. When in
doubt, think of the number line: if one number is to the right of the number,
then it is larger. As the number line below illustrates, &ndash;2 is to the
right of &ndash;4.5. Hence, &ndash;2 is larger than <span class="equation">&ndash;4.5</span>.</p>
