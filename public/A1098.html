	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>Common knowledge tells us that
sensible exercise and <u>eating properly will result</u> in better health. </div><div

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect since <em>eating properly</em> (verb-adverb) is
not parallel to <em>sensible exercise</em> (adjective-noun).</p>

<p>Choice (B) offers two parallel nouns, <em>exercise</em>
and <em>diet</em>. However, a general truth should be expressed in
the present tense, not in the past tense.</p>

<p>Choice (C) is not parallel since it pairs the noun <em>exercise</em>
with the gerund (a verb acting as a noun) <em>dieting</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (E) makes the same mistake as choice (A).</p>

<p>Choice (D) offers two parallel nouns&mdash;<em>exercise</em>
and <em>diet</em>&mdash;and two parallel verbs&mdash;<em>tells</em>
and <em>results</em>. <strong>The answer is (D).</p>
