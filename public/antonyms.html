	<h1>ANTONYMS</h1></p>

<p>Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings. Just as
there are few (if any) exact synonyms, there are few (if any) exact antonyms.</p>



<p>In the antonym pair EGOIST : ALTRUISM, an EGOIST is one who
thinks only of himself, whereas ALTRUISM is characteristic of one who thinks of
all humanity. Often, however, the antonym pair are direct opposites as in the
pair REMAIN : DEPART.</p>



<p><strong>Example: <br>
UNPRECEDENTED : PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE
::</strong></div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>naive
: harmony</p></li><li><p>incomparable : equal</p></li><li><p>improper
: vacillation</p></li><li><p>eccentric : intensity</p></li><li><p>random
: recidivism</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>UNPRECEDENTED
means "without PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE."
Similarly, INCOMPARABLE means "without EQUAL."
<strong>The answer is (B)</strong>.</p>

<p></strong>Note: In the other answer-pairs there is no
clear relationship between the words. Hence, this problem can also be solved by
elimination, without even knowing the meanings of the original pair.</p>
