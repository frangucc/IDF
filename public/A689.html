class="solution">Solution:</span>NOISOME
is a very negative word, so we are looking for a very positive word. Now, "multifarious"
is neutral: it means "diverse, many-sided."
"Provident" is a
positive synonym for "miserly."
"Officious" is
negative: it means "acting like an official,
sticking your nose into other people&rsquo;s business."
Finally, both "salubrious"
and "affable" are
positive, but "salubrious"
(healthful) is more positive. So (A) is the answer. NOISOME means "noxious."</p>
