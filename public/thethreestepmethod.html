	<h1>The Three Step Method</h1></p>


<p><u><strong>THE THREE STEP METHOD</strong></u></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> (Optional) Preview the first sentence of
each paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Read the passage at a faster than usual pace (but not to
the point that comprehension suffers). Stay alert to places from which any of
the six questions might be drawn:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.) Main Idea </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.) Description</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.) Writing Technique</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.) Extension</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.) Application</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.) Tone</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Annotate the passage and note any pivotal words. Then use
them as reference points when answering the questions. Following are some
common annotation marks (you may want to add to this list):</p>

<p>A = A</strong>uthor&rsquo;s <strong>A</strong>ttitude<strong></p>

<p>C = C</strong>omplex point<strong></p>

<p>? = Question?</strong> I don&rsquo;t understand
this part (you can bet that this area will be<strong> </strong>important
to <em>at least</em> one question)<strong></p>

<p>SP =</strong> <strong>S</strong>ignificant
<strong>p</strong>oint<strong></p>

<p>! = Exclamation!</strong> Strong opinion<strong></p>

<p>W = W</strong>eak, questionable or unsupported
argument or premise<strong></p>

<p></strong></p>

<p>Notice how the three-step process proceeds from the general
to the specific. The<strong> first step</strong>, previewing the
first sentences, gives you an overview of the passage. This will help you
answer main idea questions. The<strong> second step</strong>,
reading the passage at a slightly faster than usual pace, brings out the
passage&rsquo;s structure (i.e., does the author compare and contrast, show
cause and effect, etc.). Further, it will clue you into the author&rsquo;s
attitude (positive, negative, objective, indifferent, etc.). Finally, the<strong>
third step</strong>, noting pivotal words and annotating, will solidify
your understanding of the passage and highlight specific details. </p>

<p>The three step method should be viewed as a dynamic, and not
a static, process. The steps often overlap and they are not performed in strict
order. Comprehending a passage is an ebb and flow process. Analyzing a passage
to understand how it is constructed can be compared to dismantling an engine to
understand how it was built&mdash;you may stop occasionally and reassemble
parts of it to review what you just did; then proceed again to dismantle more. Likewise,
when reading a passage, you may first read and annotate a paragraph
(disassembling it) and then go back and skim to reassemble it. During this
process, comprehension proceeds from the global to the specific. This can be
represented by an inverted pyramid:</p>

<p><img width=290 height=189
src="image001.jpg"></p>

<p>In the conjecture stage, we form a tentative main idea&mdash;one
which we may have to modify or even reject as we read more deeply into the
passage. In the general understanding stage, we develop a feel for the author&rsquo;s
tone and discover the schema that she uses to present her ideas. In the
specific understanding stage, we fill in the minor gaps in our understanding. Finally,
in the incorporation stage, we integrate the ideas presented in the passage
into our own thought process. We now understand the ideas sufficiently to
defend them, apply them to other situations, or evaluate their validity in a
hypothetical situation. Only with complete understanding of the passage can
this be done.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s apply the three step method to the passage
on the next page. Begin by previewing the first sentence of each paragraph: </p>

<p>The sentence <em>"That
placebos can cure everything from dandruff to leprosy is well
known"</em> implies that the passage is about
placebos and that they are perhaps cure-alls.</p>

<p>The sentence <em>"Every
drug tested would prove effective if special steps were not taken to neutralize
the placebo effect"</em> gives the first bit
of evidence supporting the topic sentence.</p>

<p>The sentence <em>"Most
people feel that the lucky patients in a drug test get the experimental drug
because the real drug provides them a chance to be
cured"</em> might be introducing a
counter-premise or pivotal point; we won&rsquo;t know until we read the
passage.</p>

<p>The sentence <em>"Placebos
regularly cure more than five percent of the patients and would cure
considerably more if the doubts associated with the tests were
eliminated"</em> provides more support for
the topic sentence.</p>

<p>The sentence <em>"The
actual curing power of placebos probably stems from the faith of the patient in
the treatment"</em> explains why the topic
sentence is true.</p>

<p>The sentence <em>"It may
take a while to reach the ten percent level of cure because any newly
established program will not have cultivated the word-of-mouth advertising
needed to insure its success"</em> is hard to
interpret. This does not help us.</p>

<p>The sentence <em>"Unfortunately,
placebo treatment centers cannot operate as nonprofit
businesses"</em> seems to be off the subject.
Again, this does not help us. </p>

<p>In summary, although the last two sentences were not useful,
we now have a good idea of what the passage is about: <em>how</em>
and <em>why</em> placebos are effective. We now read the passage&mdash;looking
for places from which any of the six questions might be drawn, noting the
pivotal words, and annotating key points. </p>

<p>Passage begins on the next page. c</p>

<p><strong></p>

<p></strong>That placebos can cure everything from
dandruff to leprosy is well known. They have a long history of use by witch
doctors, faith healers, and even modern physicians, all of whom refuse to admit
their efficacy. Modern distribution techniques can bring this most potent of
medicines to the aid of everyone, not just those lucky enough to receive
placebos in a medical testing program.<strong></p>

<p></strong>Every drug tested would prove effective if
special steps were not taken to neutralize the placebo effect. This is why drug
tests give half the patients the new medication and half a harmless substitute.
These tests prove the value of placebos because approximately five percent of
the patients taking them are cured even though the placebos are made from
substances that have been carefully selected to be useless.</p>

<p>Most people feel that the lucky patients in a drug test get
the experimental drug because the real drug provides them a chance to be cured.
<strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Yet</strong> analysis
shows that patients getting the placebo may be the lucky ones because they may
be cured without risking any adverse effects the new drug may have. Furthermore,
the drug may well be found worthless and to have severe side effects. No
harmful side effects result from placebos.</p>

<p>Placebos regularly cure more than five percent of the
patients and would cure considerably more if the doubts associated with the
tests were eliminated. Cures are principally due to the patient&rsquo;s
faith, <strong>(2) yet</strong> the patient must have doubts
knowing that he may or may not be given the new drug, which itself may or may
not prove to be an effective drug. Since he knows the probability of being
given the true drug is about fifty percent, the placebo cure rate would be more
than doubled by removing these doubts if cures are directly related to faith.</p>

<p>The actual curing power of placebos probably stems from the
faith of the patient in the treatment. This suggests that cure rates in the ten
percent range could be expected if patients are given placebos under the guise
of a proven cure, even when patients know their problems are incurable.</p>

<p>It may take a while to reach the ten percent level of cure
because any newly established program will not have cultivated the
word-of-mouth advertising needed to insure its success. One person saying "I
was told that my problem was beyond medical help, but they cured me,"
can direct countless people to the treatment with the required degree of faith.
Furthermore, when only terminal illnesses are treated, those not cured tell no
one of the failure.</p>

<p><strong></p>

<p></strong>Unfortunately, placebo treatment centers
cannot operate as nonprofit businesses. The nonprofit idea was ruled out upon
learning that the first rule of public medicine is never to give free medicine.
Public health services know that medicine not paid for by patients is often not
taken or not effective because the recipient feels the medicine is worth just
what it cost him. <strong>(3) Even though</strong> the patients
would not know they were taking sugar pills, the placebos cost so little that
the patients would have no faith in the treatment. Therefore, though it is
against higher principles, treatment centers must charge high fees for placebo
treatments. This sacrifice of principles, however, is a small price to pay for
the greater good of the patients.</p>

<p><strong></p>

<p></strong>The first item is a main idea question:</p>

<p>1. Which one of the following best expresses the main idea
of the passage?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Placebo
treatment is a proven tool of modern medicine and its expanded use would
benefit society&rsquo;s health.</p></li><li><p>Because
modern technology allows for distribution of drugs on a massive scale, the proven
efficacy of the placebo is no longer limited to a privileged few.</p></li><li><p>The
curative power of the placebo is so strong that it should replace proven drugs
because the patients receiving the placebo will then be cured without risking
any adverse side effects.</p></li><li><p>The price of
placebo treatment must be kept artificially high because patients have little
faith in inexpensive treatments.</p></li><li><p>Semi-placebos&mdash;drugs
that contain only a small amount of the usual dosage&mdash;are even more
effective curatives than either the placebo or the full-strength drug.</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>As
we found by previewing the topic sentences, the passage is about the efficacy
of placebo treatment. Careful reading shows that the passage also promotes
expanded use of placebos. Hence <strong>the answer is (A)</strong>.</p>

<p>The other choices can be quickly dismissed. (B)
is the second-best choice: the author <em>does</em> mention that
modern distribution techniques can bring the curative power of placebos to
everyone, but he does <u>not</u> fully develop that idea. This
answer-choice is tempting because it is contained in the topic paragraph. As to
(C), it overstates the author&rsquo;s claim. Although in the third
paragraph, the author states that those who receive the placebos may be the
lucky ones, this is referring to new, unproven drugs, not to established drugs.
As to (D), it, like (B), is mentioned in the passage but is not fully
developed. It&rsquo;s tempting because it appears in the last paragraph&mdash;a
natural place for the conclusion. Finally, (E) is neither mentioned nor implied
by the passage.</p>

<p>The second item is an application question.</p>

<p>2. Which one of the following is most analogous to the idea
presented in the last paragraph?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Buying
a television at a discount house</p></li><li><p>Making
an additional pledge to charity</p></li><li><p>Choosing
the most expensive dishwasher in a manufacturer&rsquo;s line</p></li><li><p>Waiting
until a book comes out in paperback</p></li><li><p>Contributing
one dollar to the Presidential Campaign fund on your tax return</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div>
<div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
information needed to answer this question is heralded by the pivotal phrase "Even
though". The implication of
that sentence is "you get what you pay for."
This would motivate one to buy the most expensive item in a manufacturer&rsquo;s
line. Hence <strong>the answer is (C)</strong>.</p>



<p>The third item is a description question.</p>

<p>3. According to the passage, when testing a new drug medical
researchers give half of the subjects the test drug and half a placebo because</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>proper
statistical controls should be observed.</p></li><li><p>this
method reduces the risk of maiming too many subjects if the drug should prove
to be harmful.</p></li><li><p>all drugs which are
tested would prove to be effective otherwise.</p></li><li><p>most
drugs would test positively otherwise.</p></li><li><p>the
cost of dispensing drugs to all the patients is prohibitive. </p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
this is a description question, you must refer to the passage to answer it. The
opening sentence to paragraph two contains the needed information. That
sentence states "<u>Every</u> drug
would prove effective if special steps were not taken to neutralize the placebo
effect." Hence <strong>the answer is
(C)</strong>. </p>

<p>Choice (D) illustrates why you must refer
directly to the passage to answer a description question: unless you have a
remarkable memory, you will be unsure whether the statement was that <strong>all</strong>
or that <strong>most</strong> drugs would prove effective.</p>

<p>The fourth item is an extension question.</p>

<p>4. It can be inferred from the passage that the author might</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>believe
that the benefits of a placebo treatment program that lead patients to believe
they were getting a real drug would outweigh the moral issue of lying.</p></li><li><p>
support legislation outlawing the use of placebos.</p></li><li><p>open
up a medical clinic that would treat patients exclusively through placebo
methods.</p></li><li><p>believe that factors other than
faith are responsible for the curative power of the placebo.</p></li><li><p>believe
that placebo treatment centers should be tax-exempt because they are nonprofit
businesses. </p>

<p></p></li></ol></div>
<div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span><strong>The
answer is (A)</strong>. One of the first clues to the author&rsquo;s
view on this issue is contained in the pivotal clause "yet
the patient . . . effective drug" .
Later, in paragraph six, the author nearly advocates that the patient should
not be told that he or she might be receiving a placebo. Finally, the closing
line of the passage cinches it. There, the author implies that certain
principles <em>can be</em> sacrificed for the greater good of the
patients.</p>

<p>The fifth item is a writing technique question.</p>

<p>5. Which one of the following best describes the
organization of the material presented in the passage?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>A
general proposition is stated; then evidence for its support is given.</p></li><li><p>Two
types of drug treatment&mdash;placebo and non-placebo&mdash;are
compared and contrasted.</p></li><li><p>A result is
stated, its cause is explained, and an application is suggested.</p></li><li><p>A
dilemma is presented and a possible solution is offered.</p></li><li><p>A
series of examples is presented; then a conclusion is drawn from them.</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>In
the first paragraph the author claims that placebos can cure everything from
dandruff to leprosy&mdash;this is a result. Then in paragraphs two, three,
four, and five, he explains the causes of the result. Finally, he alludes to an
application&mdash;the placebo treatment centers. <strong>The answer
is (C)</strong>.</p>
<p>The sixth item is a tone question.</p>

<p>6. Which one of the following most accurately characterizes
the author&rsquo;s attitude toward placebo treatment?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>reserved
advocacy</p></li><li><p>feigned objectivity</p></li><li><p>summary
dismissal</p></li><li><p>perplexed by its effectiveness</p></li><li><p>zealous
promotion</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
question is a little tricky. Only choices (A) and (B) have any real merit. Although
the passage has a detached, third-person style, the author nonetheless <em>does</em>
present his opinions&mdash;namely that placebos work and that their use
should be expanded. However, that advocacy is reserved, so <strong>the
answer is (A)</strong>.</p>

<p>The other choices can be quickly eliminated:</p>

<p>"Summary dismissal"
is not supported by the passage. Besides, a scholar would never summarily
dismiss something; he would consider it carefully&mdash;or at least give
the impression that he has&mdash;before rejecting it. This eliminates (C).</p>

<p>Given the human ego, we are unlikely to admit that we don&rsquo;t
understand the subject we are writing about. This eliminates (D).</p>

<p>"Zealous promotion"
is too strong; "promotion"
itself is probably too strong. This eliminates (E).</p>
