class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) has two flaws. First, the subject of the sentence <em>the
rise</em> is singular, and therefore the verb <em>indicate</em>
should not be plural. Second, the comma indicates that the sentence is made up
of two independent clauses, but the relative pronoun <em>that</em>
immediately following <em>therefore</em> forms a subordinate
clause.</p>

<p>Choice (C) corrects the number of the verb, but retains the
subordinating relative pronoun <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (D) corrects the number of the verb and eliminates
the subordinating relative pronoun <em>that</em>. However, the verb
<em>being</em> is less descriptive than the verb <em>becoming</em>:
As negative attitudes toward foreigners increase, the country becomes
correspondingly less tolerant. <em>Being</em> does not capture this
notion of change.</p>

<p>Choice (E) corrects the verb&rsquo;s number, and by
dropping the comma, makes the subordination allowable. However, it introduces
the preposition <em>of</em> which does not have an object: less
tolerant of what?</p>

<p>Choice (B) both corrects the verb&rsquo;s number and
removes the subordinating relative pronoun <em>that</em>. <strong>The
answer is (B).</p>
