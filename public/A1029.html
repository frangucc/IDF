class="solution">Solution:</span>The
phrase "all but"
implies that the debate was a make-or-break event for the candidate. Suppose
the candidate did well. Then his spirits would be high, and we would expect the
missing word to be positive. However, a positive word in the phrase <em>"all
but </em><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>
<em>any hope"</em> is awkward. <br>Hence,
the candidate must have done poorly in the debate and had his hopes for
election nixed. So we turn to the answer-choices looking for "nixed."
It&rsquo;s not there, but a synonym&mdash;nullifies&mdash;is. <strong>The
answer is (A).</strong></p>
