is made up of BUILDINGS. Similarly, a COMMONWEALTH is made up of COUNTRIES. <strong>The
answer is (E).</strong></span></p>

<p>Don"t
make the mistake of choosing either (A) or (B). Although both involve the
relation of part to whole, the direction in both is not the same as in the
original pair. A COMPOUND is made up of BUILDINGS. But a CLASSROOM is not made
up of CAMPUSES, rather a CAMPUS is made of CLASSROOMS. Similarly, a DEPARTMENT
is not made up of GOVERNMENTS, rather GOVERNMENTS are made up of DEPARTMENTS.</span></p>
