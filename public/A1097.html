</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) has two flaws. First, the introductory phrase is too long. Second, the
subject Ansel Adams should immediately follow the introductory phrase since it
was Ansel Adams&mdash;not the year 1945&mdash;who was traveling and
shooting the Southwest.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is incorrect because the phrase <em> traveling
across  Southwest"</em> is too far from its
subject Ansel Adams. As written, the sentence seems to imply that the
photographic career was traveling across and shooting the Southwest.</p>

<p>Choice (C) is inconsistent in verb tense. Further, it
implies that Adams began his photographic career after he traveled across the
Southwest.</p>

<p>Choice (D) is awkward.</p>

<p><strong>The best answer is choice (E).</p>
