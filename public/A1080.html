class="solution">Solution:</span>One
would reasonably assume (preconceive) that a state where parents are alleged to
have sold their children in exchange for food is an "impoverished"
state. <strong>The answer is (C).</strong> Note, (D) is the
second-best choice. Although an impoverished state is probably impotent, impov erished
describes the situation better. Further, the sentence does not imply that the
preconceived notions of the state were unwarranted (not justified).</p>
