</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect. Although the first two phrases, <em>war brewing in
Europe </em>and <em>the industrial revolution
well-established</em>, have different structures, the thoughts are
parallel. However, the third phrase, <em>and a nascent communication
age</em>, is not parallel to the first two.</p>

<p>Choice (B) does not make the third phrase parallel to the
first two.</p>

<p>Choice (C) changes the meaning of the sentence: the new formulation
states that war already existed in Europe while the original sentence states
that war was only developing.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is not parallel since the first two phrases in
the series are noun phrases, but <em>saw the birth of the communication
age</em> is a verb phrase. When a word introduces a series, each element
of the series must agree with the introductory word. You can test the
correctness of a phrase in a series by dropping the other phrases and checking
whether the remaining phrase agrees with the introductory word. In this series,
each phrase must be the object of the preposition <em>with</em>:</p>

<p>This century began <em>with</em> war brewing in
Europe</p>

<p>This century began <em>with</em> the industrial
revolution well-established</p>

<p>This century began <em>with</em> saw the birth
of the communication age</p>

<p>In this form, it is clear the verb <em>saw</em>
cannot be the object of the preposition <em>with</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (D) offers three phrases in parallel form. <strong>The
answer is (D).</p>
