	<h1>Writing Your Issue Essay</h1></p>

<p>Now that you are familiar with the different methods you can
employ to write your essay, let&rsquo;s get down to the nitty gritty of
organizing your thoughts by using these patterns of development. Remember, you
are aiming for a 6 essay, one that presents clear, concise evidence to support
your view. Writing a 6 essay doesn&rsquo;t have to be a difficult task. All
you have to do is follow seven simple steps, some of which will ask you to plug
information into formulas. Note that some steps may include specific formulas
for each pattern of development. Also note that you need not enter complete,
descriptive sentences into the formulas; simple notes and phrases will suffice.</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 1</strong> &ndash; Understanding the
Issue</p>

<p></u>In order to properly present your
perspective on an issue, you must first understand the issue you are being
asked to discuss. Understanding the issue allows you to fully develop your
position, presenting your evidence in a way that is most effective and
appropriate for the topic. There are two steps that will help you understand
the issue.</p>

<p>First, take a couple of minutes to read the given question
carefully. Second, ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<p>&bull; What does the statement mean?</p>

<p>&bull; What is the issue at hand?</p>

<p>&bull; What is implied by the statement?</p>

<p>&bull; What is the writer&rsquo;s stand on
the issue?</p>

<p>&bull; What, if any, evidence does the writer use
to support his position?</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 2</strong> &ndash; Choosing Your
Pattern of Development</p>

<p></u>Keeping in mind our discussion of
the three patterns of development, look for the necessary criteria in your
question. If you think the question requires more than one method, choose the
one you think works the best. On a timed writing assignment, your essay will be
fairly short and therefore you cannot adequately utilize two methods.</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 3</strong> &ndash; Developing Your
Thesis</u></p>

<p>The next, and perhaps the most
important, step is to develop your thesis. Your thesis states the purpose of
your essay. Without a thesis statement, your reader does not know what you are
setting out to prove. And without a thesis statement, it would be very
difficult to organize your essay with clarity and coherence. Don&rsquo;t be
intimidated by the task of formulating what is to be the crux of your essay. It
can be quite simple. Just use the formulas below:</p>

<p>THESIS FOR COMPARISON &ndash; CONTRAST ESSAY <em>(formula
1-1)</em>:</p>

<p>I believe that Item A, __________, is better than Item B,
__________, because </p>

<p>1) __________, 2) __________, 3) __________.</p>

<p>THESIS FOR CAUSE &ndash; EFFECT ESSAY <em>(formula
1-2)</em>:</p>

<p>If _____________, then _____________, because </p>

<p>1) __________, 2) __________, 3) __________.</p>

<p>THESIS FOR DEFINITION ESSAY <em>(formula
1-3)</em>:</p>

<p>By definition, __________ possess(es) these qualities: 1)
__________,</p>

<p>2) __________, 3) __________ which have a positive effect
because</p>

<p>A) __________, B) __________, C) __________.</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 4</strong> &ndash; Understanding
Counter Arguments</u></p>

<p></u>Have you ever been in an argument
and find that you&rsquo;re just not getting very far very fast? This could
be because you are failing to see things from the other person&rsquo;s
point of view. Being able to see the "flip side of
the coin" can go a long way in proving your point
and disarming your opponent&rsquo;s objections. By showing that you are
aware, though perhaps not understanding, of the opposing side you are adding
credibility to your argument because it is clear that you have viewed the issue
from all angles. To write an effective position essay, you must present your
knowledge of a counter argument. In other words, you must show that you have
considered the other side of the argument. Organize your counter argument this
way:</p>

<p><strong>COMPARISON &ndash; CONTRAST COUNTER CLAIM <em>(formula 2-1)</em>:</strong></p>

<p>Others may think Item B is better than Item A because 1)
__________,</p>

<p>2) __________, 3) __________.</p>

<p>(Note that these three points should contrast directly with
the three points of your thesis. (see <em>formula 1-1</em>))</p>

<p><strong>CAUSE &ndash; EFFECT COUNTER CLAIM <em>(formula
2-2)</em>:<u></strong></p>

<p></u>Some may feel that __________ would cause
__________ based on __________.</p>

<p>(Note that this point should contrast directly with point #1
of your thesis. (see <em>formula 1-2</em>))</p>

<p><strong>DEFINITION <em>(formula 2-3)</em>:</strong></p>

<p>By definition some may feel that __________ exhibits or is
defined by __________ which could be positive / negative.</p>

<p>(Note that this point should contrast directly with point #1
of your thesis. (see <em>formula 1-3</em>))</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 5</strong> &ndash; Organizing Your
Thoughts</u></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s organize all of our
information so that writing the essay will be quick and simple. Following are
formulas specific to each pattern of development. These formulas will prompt
you to plug in your thesis and counter argument points. (Note that the
following formulas require you to plug in the three numbered items from your
thesis in succession. Although it is not necessary that you discuss them in
this order, we will label it that way for simplicity.) In addition, there are
spaces in the formula for you to insert 1 or 2 pieces of supporting evidence. </p>

<p><u><strong>Step 6</strong> &ndash; Writing Your Essay</u></p>

<p>Now that you have organized your thoughts and
support, it is time to write! The best strategy under the pressure of a time
restraint is to just begin writing&mdash;as quickly as you can while still
being careful. (You should allow yourself about 25 of the 45 minutes for
writing.) Organization should not be difficult with the help of your formulas.
In following your formula, don&rsquo;t forget to add transitional words,
phrases and sentences to help give your essay coherence. As you write, remember
the mechanical rules you learned at the beginning of this chapter and keep in
mind the techniques we discussed in the section <em>General Tips on
Writing Your Essays</em>. The key to successful timed writings is to
reserve a bit of time at the end so that you can go back and proofread and add
finishing touches that will make your essay flow well and that will present
your ideas clearly.</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 7</strong> &ndash; Revising Your Essay</u></p>

<p>Because you have written quickly, you must
spend some time, about 5-8 minutes, at the end of the section reviewing your
essay, making necessary changes to enhance the clarity, coherence and
grammatical accuracy of your writing. You must look for misspellings and
mechanical errors while at the same time keeping in mind the following
questions:</p>

<p>&bull; Is my introduction captivating?</p>

<p>&bull; Is my thesis statement concise?</p>

<p>&bull; Do my body paragraphs clearly support my
thesis?</p>

<p>&bull; Have I used logical transitions that help
the text flow smoothly between sentences and between paragraphs?</p>

<p>&bull; Have I maintained a formal tone and
diction throughout my essay?</p>

<p>&bull; Have I maintained consistent use of person
(i.e., first, second, third)?</p>

<p>&bull; Is there a word, or are there words, which
I have employed too often throughout the essay?</p>

<p>&bull; Do my sentences vary in length and
structure?</p>

<p>As you ask yourself these questions, make the
necessary changes. If you still have time left after you have completed the
initial revision, go back and read your essay again. A writer makes many, many
revisions to his manuscript before it is ready to be published, so you can
never proofread too many times!</p>
