The distance between cities A and B is 120
miles. A car travels from A to B at 60 miles per hour and returns from B to A
along the same route at 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed for the
round trip?</p>

</div><div class="options"><ol id="list3"><li><p> 48</p>

</p></li><li><p> 50</p>

</p></li><li><p> 52</p>

</ol></div>
	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> We can eliminate 50 (the mere average
of 40 and 60) since that would be too elementary. Now, the average must be
closer to 40 than to 60 because the car travels for a longer time at 40 mph. But
48 is the only number given that is closer to 40 than to 60. <strong>The
answer is A</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s instructive to also calculate the answer. <span class="equation"><em>Average speed</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp; <span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;<em>Total Distance</em>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>
</span>
. Now, a car traveling
at 40 mph will cover 120 miles in 3 hours. And a car traveling at 60 mph will
cover the same 120 miles in 2 hours. So the total traveling time is 5 hours. <br>Hence,
for the round trip, the average speed is <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;120&nbsp;+&nbsp;120&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;48
</span>.</p>
