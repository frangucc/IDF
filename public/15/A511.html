class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>x</em> denote the number of apples bought, and let <em>y</em>
denote the number of oranges bought. Then, translating the sentence <em>"Steve
bought some apples at a cost of $.60 each and some oranges at a cost of $.50
each"</em> into an equation yields</p>

<p>.60<em>x</em> + .50<em>y</em> = 4.10</p>

<p>Since there are two variables and only one equation, the key
to this problem is finding a second equation that relates <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em>. Since he bought a total of 8 apples and oranges, we
get </p>

<p><em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 8</p>

<p>Solving this system yields <em>x</em> = 1. <br>Hence,
he bought one apple, and <strong>the answer is (A).</strong></p>
