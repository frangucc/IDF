	<h1>Subject-Verb Agreement</h1>
	<p>Within a sentence there are certain requirements for the
relationship between the subject and the verb.</p>

<p>  The subject and verb must agree both in
number and person.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  We have surpassed our sales goal of one
million dollars.</p>

<p>Here, the first person plural verb <em>have</em>
agrees with its first person plural subject <em>we</em>.</p>

<p>Note that, ironically, third person <u>singular</u>
verbs often end in <em>s</em> or <em>es</em>:</p>

<p>He <em>seems</em> to be fair.</p>

<p>  Intervening phrases and clauses have no
effect on subject-verb agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Only one of the President&rsquo;s
nominees was confirmed.</p>

<p>Here, the singular verb <em>was</em>
agrees with its singular subject <em>one</em>. The intervening
prepositional phrase <em>of the President&rsquo;s nominees</em>
has no effect on the number or person of the verb.</p>

<p>Collective nouns followed by intervening
phrases are particularly easy to miss.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The <em>content</em> of the boxes
<em>is</em> what she wants.</p>

<p>The <em>meaning</em> of her sentences
<em>is</em> not clear.</p>

<p>A <em>group</em> of lions <em>is</em>
called a "pride."</p>

<p>Be careful when a simple subject is followed
by a phrase beginning with <em>as well as, along with, together with, in
addition to,</em> or a similar expression. Be sure to make the verb agree
with the simple subject, not with a noun in the intervening phrase.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Our <em>Senator,</em> along with
most congressmen, <em>opposes</em> the bill.</p>

<p>Here, the singular verb <em>opposes</em>
agrees with its singular subject <em>Senator</em>. The intervening
phrase <em>along with most congressmen</em> has no effect on the
number or person of the verb.</p>

<p>  When the subject and verb are reversed,
they still must agree in both number and person.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><em><br>
  Attached</em> <em>are</em>
<em>copies</em> of the contract.</p>

<p>Here, the plural verb <em>are
attached</em> agrees with its plural subject <em>copies</em>.
The sentence could be rewritten as</p>

<p><em>Copies</em> of the contract <em>are
attached</em>.</p>
