class="solution">Solution:</span>The
word "age" in the
sentence implies that the missing word is characteristic of age. "Youthful"
fits well: Despite her advanced age, she has a youthful sense of humor. <strong>The
answer is (E).</strong> "Adolescent"
could also work in the sentence, but the phrase "adolescent
sense of humor" carries a negative connotation, and
the sentence does not seem to be critical.</p>
