</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect since the singular subject <em>the harvest</em>
requires a singular verb, not the plural verb <em>were</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is illogical since it states that the harvest
began to decrease in 1990 and then it states that it was the third straight
year of decrease.</p>

<p>In choice (C) the plural verb <em>were</em>
still does not agree with its singular subject <em>the harvest</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (E) contains the same flaw as choice (B).</p>

<p>Choice (D) has the singular verb <em>was</em> agreeing
with its singular subject <em>the harvest</em>. Further, it places
the phrase <em>in 1990</em> more naturally. <strong>The
answer is (D).</p>
