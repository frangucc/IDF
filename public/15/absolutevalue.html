	<h1>Absolute Value</h1>

<p></strong>The absolute value of a number is its
distance on the number line from 0. Since distance is a positive number,
absolute value of a number is positive. Two vertical bars denote the absolute
value of a number: <span class="equation">| <em>x</em> |</span>. For example, <span class="equation">| 3 |&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</span> and <span class="equation">| &minus;3 |&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</span>. This can be illustrated on
the number line:</p>

<p>Students rarely struggle with the absolute value of numbers:
if the number is negative, simply make it positive; and if it is already
positive, leave it as is. For example, since &ndash;2.4 is negative, <span class="equation">| &minus;2.4 |&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.4</span> and since 5.01 is
positive <span class="equation">| 5.01 |&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.01</span>.</p>

<p>Further, students rarely struggle with the absolute value of
positive variables: if the variable is positive, simply drop the absolute value
symbol. For example, if <em>x</em> > 0, then <span class="equation">| <em>x</em> |&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>x</em></span>.</p>

<p>However, negative variables can cause students much
consternation. If <em>x</em> is negative, then <span class="equation">| <em>x</em> |&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;<em>x</em></span>. This often confuses
students because the absolute value is positive but the &ndash;<em>x</em>
appears to be negative. It is actually positive&mdash;it is the negative of
a negative number, which is positive. To see this more clearly let <em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&ndash;<em>k</em>,
where <em>k</em> is a positive number. Then <em>x</em>
is a negative number. So <span class="equation">| <em>x</em> |&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;<em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;(&minus;<em>k</em>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>k</em></span>. Since <em>k</em> is
positive so is &ndash;<em>x</em>. Another way to view this is <span class="equation">| <em>x</em> |&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;<em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(&minus;1)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;=</span>&nbsp;(&ndash;1)(a
negative number) <br>
= a positive number.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
 If <span class="equation"><em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;| <em>x</em> |</span>, then which one of the
following statements could be true?</p>

<p>I. <em>x</em> = 0</p>

<p>II. <em>x</em> < 0</p>

<p>III. <em>x</em> > 0</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>None</p></li><li><p>I
only</p></li><li><p>III only</p></li><li><p>I
and II</p></li><li><p>II and III</p>

<p></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Statement
I could be true because <span class="equation">&minus;| 0 |&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;(+0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span>. Statement II could be true because
the right side of the equation is always negative. [<span class="equation">&minus;| <em>x</em> |&nbsp;= &ndash;(a positive number) <br>
= a
negative number].</span> Now, if one side of an equation is always negative, then the
other side must always be negative, otherwise the opposite sides of the
equation would not be equal. Since Statement III is the opposite of Statement
II, it must be false. But let&rsquo;s show this explicitly: Suppose <em>x</em>
were positive. Then <span class="equation">| <em>x</em> |&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>x</em></span>, and the equation <span class="equation"><em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;| <em>x</em> |</span> becomes <em>x</em>
= &ndash;<em>x</em>. Dividing both sides of this equation by <em>x</em>
yields 1 = &ndash;1. This is contradiction. Hence, <em>x</em>
cannot be positive. <strong>The answer is (D)</strong>.</p>
