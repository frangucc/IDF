	<h1>Usage</h1></p>

<p>Even if you know all of the rules that govern the proper use
of punctuation, your knowledge will not enhance your writing if you do not use
correct grammar in your writing. The field of grammar is huge and complex&mdash;tomes
have been written on the subject. This complexity should be no surprise since
grammar deals with the process of communication.</p>

<p>Usage concerns how we choose our words and how we express
our thoughts: in other words, are the connections between the words in a
sentence logically sound, and are they expressed in a way that conforms to
standard idiom? We will study six major categories:</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Pronoun
Errors</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Subject-Verb
Agreement</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Misplaced
Modifiers</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Faulty
Parallelism</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Faulty Verb
Tense</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Faulty Idiom</p>
