	<h1>Pacing</h1>

<p>Although time is limited on the GRE, working too quickly can
damage your score. Many problems hinge on subtle points, and most require
careful reading of the setup. Because undergraduate school puts such heavy
reading loads on students, many will follow their academic conditioning and
read the questions quickly, looking only for the gist of what the question is
asking. Once they have found it, they mark their answer and move on, confident
they have answered it correctly. Later, many are startled to discover that they
missed questions because they either misread the problems or overlooked subtle
points.</p>

<p>To do well in your undergraduate classes, you had to attempt
to solve every, or nearly every, problem on a test. Not so with the GRE. In
fact, if you try to solve every problem on the test, you will probably damage
your score. For the vast majority of people, the key to performing well on the
GRE is not the number of questions they solve, within reason, but the
percentage they solve correctly.</p>

<p>On the GRE, the first question will be of medium difficulty.
If you answer it correctly, the next question will be a little harder. If you
answer it incorrectly, the next question will be a little easier. Because the
CAT "adapts" to your
performance, early questions are more important than later ones. In fact, by
about the fifth or sixth question the test believes that it has a general
measure of your score, say, <span class="equation">500&ndash;600</span>. The rest of the test is
determining whether your score should be, say, 550 or 560. Because of the
importance of the first five questions to your score, you should read and solve
these questions slowly and carefully. Allot nearly one-third of the time for
each section to the first five questions. Then work progressively faster as you
work toward the end of the section.</p>
