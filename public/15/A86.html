number divisible by all three numbers 2, 3, and 4 is also divisible by 12.
<br>Hence, each number can be written as a multiple of 12. Let the first number be
represented as 12<em>a</em> and the second number as 12<em>b</em>.
Assuming <em>a</em> > <em>b</em>, the difference
between the two numbers is <span class="equation">12<em>a</em> &ndash; 12<em>b</em>
= 12(<em>a</em> &ndash; <em>b</em>)</span>. Observe that
this number is also a multiple of 12. <br>Hence, the answer must also be divisible
by 12. Since 72 is the only answer-choice divisible by 12, <strong>the
answer is (B).</strong></p>
