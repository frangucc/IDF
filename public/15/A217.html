class="solution">Solution:</span>The eye-catcher is that the two
columns are equal. That won&rsquo;t be the answer to this hard problem. Now,
if there are more girls in the class, then the average will be closer to 72
than to 70. On the other hand, if there are more boys in the class, then the
average will be closer to 70. This is a double case, and therefore <strong>the
answer is D</strong>.</p>
