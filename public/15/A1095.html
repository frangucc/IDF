</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect because the phrase <em>using the Hubble
telescope</em> does not have a noun to modify.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is incorrect because the phrase <em>using
the Hubble telescope</em> still does not have a noun to modify.</p>

<p>Choice (C) offers a noun, <em>astronomers</em>,
but it is too far from the phrase <em>using the Hubble
telescope</em>.</p>

<p>In choice (E), the phrase <em>with the aid of the
Hubble telescope</em> does not have a noun to modify.</p>

<p>Choice (D) offers a noun, <em>astronomers</em>,
and places it immediately after the modifying phrase <em>using the Hubble
telescope</em>. <strong>The answer is (D).</p>
