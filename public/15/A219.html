  mid point of AB is M.</p>
  
<p><strong>Column A</strong><br>

class="solution">Solution:</span>Most people will draw the figure as
follows:</p>

<p><img width=201 height=108 src="qimage032.gif"></p>

<p>In this drawing, CM equals DM. But that is too ordinary. There
must be a way to draw the lines so that the lengths are not equal. One such
drawing is as follows:</p>

<p><img width=290 height=98 src="qimage033.gif"></p>

<p>This is a double case, and therefore <strong>the
answer is D</strong>. <br>(Note: When drawing a geometric figure, be careful
not to assume more than what is given. In this problem, we are told <u>only</u>
that the two lines are parallel and congruent; we cannot assume that they are
aligned.)</p>
