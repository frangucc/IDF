	<h1>Commas</h1>
	<p>Use a comma:</p>

<ol><li>(Rule 1) in series and lists.</li><li>(Rule
2) after an introductory phrase.</li><li>(Rule 3) to set off
nonrestrictive clauses.</li><li>(Rule 4) to set off interjections
and transitional phrases.</li><li>(Rule 5) with a coordinating
conjunction to separate two independent clauses.</li></ol><strong>Rule
1:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a comma to separate each item in a series or
list of three or more words, phrases, or clauses. Also, use commas with
descriptive words where two or more adjectives modify the same noun.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  I <u>made the beds, swept the floors, vacuumed the
carpet, and scrubbed the bathtub</u> to get ready for our guests. Then I
went shopping to stock the refrigerator with <u>drinks, vegetables, and
fruit</u>. I hope I&rsquo;m ready to welcome them into our home and
to have a great visit.</p>

<p>In this example, the four underlined clauses
in the opening series are separated by commas, and the three underlined words
in the list are separated by commas. Notice that the concluding sentence does
not contain any commas. In this sentence, the clause <em>to welcome them
into our home</em> and the clause <em>to have a great
visit</em> are part of a series of only two elements and are simply separated
by the conjunction <em>and</em>. Note that a series of words or
phrases is marked by a relationship between the elements, whereas a list is
simply a notation of two or more words that may or may not be related. For
instance, in the example above, the first sentence contains a series of
clauses. Each clause is related because they are all actions that the person
took. The second sentence contains a list of items such as you would take to
the grocery store.</p>

<p>Commas are also used with descriptive words.
Use a comma in a series of two or more adjectives that modify the same noun.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The <u>long, narrow, winding road</u> lead to a <u>beautiful,
serene lake</u>.</p>

<p>In this example, <em>long</em>,<em>
narrow</em>, and <em>winding</em> are adjectives that all
modify the noun <em>road</em>. Thus, they are separated by commas.
Likewise, <em>beautiful</em> and <em>serene</em> modify
<em>lake</em> and are separated by commas. Note that no comma
follows the last adjective in the series; also be careful in determining the
function of the last word of the series. You must make sure that all the
adjectives equally modify the noun. For example,</p>

<p>Before you watch TV, I want you to clean the <u>dirty,
grimy kitchen sink</u>.</p>

<p>In this example, <em>kitchen
sink</em> acts as a single noun because without <em>kitchen</em>,
<em>sink</em> is not adequately identified. Therefore, <em>grimy</em>
is the last adjective before the noun in the series and no comma should be
placed after it.</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>Look through your work for any
series of words, phrases or clauses. If there are two or more of these
elements, place a comma after all but the last one.</p>

<p>Example (without punctuation):</p>

<p>He thought taking a road trip would <u>help
him feel rejuvenated</u> <u>allow him to work through his
feelings</u> and <u>provide some much needed solitude in which to
get his studying done</u>.</p>

<p>Here the three clauses are underlined. Once
you have identified these clauses, you should place commas after each clause
except the last one:</p>

<p>He thought taking a road trip would help him
feel rejuvenated, allow him to work through his feelings, and provide some much
needed solitude in which to get his studying done.</p>

<p>This example contains a list of adjectives:</p>

<p>She looked longingly through the window at
the lovely elegant pearl necklace.</p>

<p>First, identify the list of words: <em>lovely</em>,
<em>elegant</em>, and <em>pearl </em>modify <em>necklace</em>.
Now confirm that each adjective equally modifies the noun <em>necklace</em>.
To do this, insert the word <em>and</em> in between each adjective:</p>

<p>She looked longingly through the window at
the lovely <em>and</em> elegant <em>and</em> pearl
necklace.</p>

<p>Clearly, the sentence does not make sense
with the <em>and</em> between <em>elegant </em>and <em>pearl</em>.
Therefore, you should place the commas appropriately:</p>

<p>She looked longingly through the window at
the lovely, elegant pearl necklace.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a comma to set off an
introductory word, phrase, or clause from the independent clause that follows.
Introductory elements that require a comma are prepositional phrases,
subordinating clauses, transitional words or phrases, and verbal phrases.</p>

<p>A <em>prepositional phrase</em>
begins with a preposition and includes any modifiers or objects. Prepositional
phrases usually signal a relationship, particularly a relationship of time or
location.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></strong><br>
<u>In the movie <em>Titanic</em></u>,
Leonardo di Caprio&rsquo;s character Jack dies.</p>

<p><u>Since the accident last year</u>, she has
been afraid to drive on the highway.</p>

<p>Both introductory clauses in these examples
begin with prepositions. The clauses indicate a relationship of location (<em><u>In</u></em>
<em>the movie...</em>) and time (<em><u>Since</u>
the accident...</em>) between the introductory phrases and the independent
clauses that follow. Therefore, they must be set off by commas.</p>

<p>A <em>subordinating clause</em>
begins with a <em>subordinator</em>, which is a word that indicates
a relationship&mdash;usually a relationship of time or location&mdash;between
the clause it begins and the independent clause that follows. This relationship
makes a subordinating clause similar to a prepositional phrase. However, unlike
a prepositional phrase, a subordinating clause can also be referred to as a
dependent clause because it has both a subject and a verb. It is a dependent
clause, not an independent clause, because it cannot stand alone as a sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong><u>When I first entered the
workforce</u>, we didn&rsquo;t have all the modern technological
conveniences that make today&rsquo;s business world move at such a rapid
pace.</p>

<p>Here the phrase <em>When I first
entered the workforce</em> begins with the subordinator <em>When</em>,
which signals a time relationship between the subordinating clause and the
independent clause that follows. Although this clause has a subject (<EM>I</EM>)
and a verb (<em>entered</em>), it cannot stand alone as a sentence
and requires the independent clause to complete the thought. Here is another
example:</p>

<p><u>Before I had a chance to
answer</u>, he snatched the paper out of my hands and threw it in the
fire.</p>

<p>Here again an introductory subordinating
clause requires the independent clause to complete the sentence. In both
examples, a comma is required to set off the subordinating clause from the
independent clause.</p>

<p><em>Transitional words and
phrases</em> add coherence to your writing. They help connect one
sentence to the next. A comprehensive list of transitional words and phrases
appears later in this app, but here are some of the most commonly used
transitions: <em>finally</em>, <em>furthermore</em>, <em>moreover</em>,
and <em>next</em> indicate sequence; <em>again</em>, <em>likewise</em>,
and <em>similarly</em> indicate comparison; <em>although</em>,
<em>but</em>, <em>however</em>, <em>by
contrast</em>, and <em>on the other hand</em> indicate
contrast; <em>for example</em>, <em>in fact</em>, and <em>specifically</em>
indicate examples; <em>accordingly</em>, <em>as a
result</em>, <em>consequently</em>, and <em>therefore</em>
indicate cause and effect.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Dear Employees,</p>

<p>I am writing to tell you about a new
incentive program we are beginning here at ABC Company. <u>Specifically</u>,
this incentive program will focus on rewarding sales. Our customer base has
dropped drastically this year. <u>Consequently</u>, we must look
for new ways to increase sales. <u>Although we have offered incentives in
the past</u>, this program will be different because it will reward you
for improvement in sales rather than for your sales numbers. <u>Furthermore</u>,
you will not only be able to earn monetary rewards, but you may also be awarded
with extra vacation days.</p>

<p>Happy selling,</p>

<p>Mr. Smith</p>

<p>In this example, transitional words and
phrases are used to make the text flow more smoothly. A comma is required after
each transitional word or phrase.</p>

<p><em>Verbal phrases</em> contain
verb elements but function as nouns, adjectives or adverbs rather than verbs.
There are two kinds of verbal phrases that can act as introductory phrases and
therefore must be set off by commas: participial phrases and infinitive
phrases.</p>

<p>Participial phrases are made up of a present
participle (the &ndash;<em>ing</em> form of a verb) or a past
participle (the &ndash;<em>ed</em> form of a verb) as well as
any modifiers or objects. Participial phrases act as adjectives because they
describe, or modify, the subject in the independent clause.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
<u>Standing alone by the door</u>,
Ricky watched the rest of the boys dance with their dates.</p>

<p><u>Angered by the kids&rsquo; cutting
remarks</u>, Naomi stormed out of the room and then burst into tears.</p>

<p>The first example contains a participial
phrase that contains the present participle <em>Standing</em>. The
introductory phrase <em>Standing alone by the door</em> describes
Ricky. In the second example, the past participle <em>Angered</em>
makes up the participial phrase, and the full introductory phrase describes
Naomi.</p>

<p>Infinitive phrases are made up of an
infinitive as well as any modifiers or objects.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
<u>To win a gold medal</u>, you
must work very hard.</p>

<p><u>To earn a high score on the GRE</u>, you must
study this guide thoroughly.</p>

<p><em>To win</em> is the infinitive
in the first sentence, and <em>To earn</em> is the infinitive in
the second sentence. Both infinitives serve as part of the introductory phrase,
which must be set off by commas.</p>

<p><strong><u>Check your work</u></strong></p>

<p>To find introductory phrases that should be
set off with a comma, first look for the subject and verb of the independent
clause. Then note any words that precede the subject and verb. Other than
articles and adjectives, any words or phrases that precede the subject and verb
make up the introductory phrase. You can then confirm this by identifying the
introductory phrase.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The strongest qualities of a teacher are
patience and understanding.</p>

<p>Here <em>qualities</em> is the
subject (don&rsquo;t be thrown off by <em>of a teacher</em>)
and <em>are</em> is the verb. <em>The</em> and <em>strongest</em>
precede the subject in this sentence. <em>The</em> is an article
and <em>strongest</em> is an adjective, so there is no need for a
comma here. Now look at this example:</p>

<p>Knowing that the strongest qualities of a
teacher are patience and understanding, Beth highlighted these qualities on her
r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</p>

<p>Here <em>Beth</em> is the subject
and <em>highlighted</em> is the verb. The phrase <em>Knowing
that the strongest qualities of a teacher are patience and
understanding</em> is a participial phrase and therefore should be set
off with a comma.</p>

<p>Many writers do not place a comma after a
short introductory clause.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  This morning I stopped at the bagel shop for
coffee.</p>

<p>Here a comma is acceptable after <em>This
morning</em>; however, it is not necessary. You can use your ear to make
a decision in cases like these. Often commas may be placed where there would be
a pause if the sentence is spoken. When in doubt, however, use a comma.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 3:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a comma to set off
nonrestrictive clauses and phrases, clauses and phrases that are not essential
in identifying the words they modify. Adjectival clauses and appositives (words
that rename a noun) are most often nonrestrictive.</p>

<p>Adjectival clauses are phrases that begin
with <em>who</em>, <em>whom</em>, <em>whose</em>,
<em>which</em>, <em>that</em>, <em>when</em>,
<em>where</em>, or <em>why</em>. In many cases, an
adjectival clause is nonrestrictive such as in the following example:</p>

<p>The heart, <u>which pumps the
body&rsquo;s blood</u>, is necessary to sustain life.</p>

<p>In this sentence, the adjectival clause <em>which
pumps the body&rsquo;s blood</em> is set off by commas because it is
not essential to the sentence. The sentence would have the same meaning without
the clause. By contrast, the adjectival clause in the next sentence is
restrictive because it is necessary to convey the meaning of the sentence:</p>

<p>The police who are investigating the murders
in Maryland are using geographic profiling to aid in their search for the
perpetrator.</p>

<p>The adjectival clause <em>who are
investigating the murders in Maryland</em> is necessary to provide the
reader with full details about the police and the murderer for whom they are
searching. Without this phrase, the reader would not know that the police are
in Maryland and that they are investigating a murderer.</p>

<p><em>Appositives</em> act as nouns or noun
substitutes by modifying the noun that precedes the appositive. Just as with
adjectival clauses, nonrestrictive appositives are set off by commas, whereas
restrictive appositives are not.</p>

<p>Nonrestrictive examples:</p>

<p>My high school English teacher, <u>Mr.
Roper</u>, taught me how to use commas properly.</p>

<p>She drove her new car, <u>a Honda Accord</u>, to
the senior center to pick up her grandmother.</p>

<p>The book club will be meeting this Wednesday to discuss the
latest book, <u>Grisham&rsquo;s
<em>Rainmaker</em></u>.</p>

<p>In these examples, the underlined phrases are
nonrestrictive appositives, which rename the noun preceding them. These phrases
add interesting description to the sentences, but they are not necessary to
make the sentences complete and understandable. On the other hand, some
appositives are essential to capture the full meaning of the sentence. Such
restrictive appositives should not be set off with commas as shown in the following
examples:</p>

<p>My son <u>Michael</u> is two
years old, and my other son <u>Jacob</u> is five months old.</p>

<p>Meet me at 6:00 at the new restaurant <em><u>Vinny&rsquo;s
Vittles</u></em> that just opened on Main Street.</p>

<p>My friend <u>Tammy</u> met me at the beach
yesterday.</p>

<p>The appositives in these examples are
necessary in specifying the subjects. This information is necessary so the
reader has a clear understanding of the subject involved in the text.</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>Review each sentence in your
writing. Identify the adjectival phrases and appositives and the nouns they
modify. For each adjectival phrase or appositive, ask yourself if the phrase
provides important identifying information about the noun, or if it just
provides "extra"
information. If you are still unsure, read the sentence without the adjectival
phrase or appositive. Does the sentence still have its full meaning? If so, set
the phrase off with commas. If not, omit the commas.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 4:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a comma to set off
interjections and transitional phrases.</p>

<p>An <em>interjection</em> is
usually one or two words that interrupt the flow of a sentence and give extra
information about the content of the sentence. Although an interjection
provides added detail that enhances the reader&rsquo;s knowledge, generally
the information provided by an interjection could be omitted with little or no
effect on the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, most interjections should be
set off by commas as in the following examples:</p>

<p>I could probably take, <u>say</u>,
five people in my van for the carpool.</p>

<p>She was, <u>oddly enough</u>, the only one who
entered the contest.</p>

<p>I was thinking, <u>by the way</u>, that we could
stop by the store on the way home.</p>

<p>A <em>transitional phrase</em>
directs the flow of an essay. Often, transitional phrases are helpful in
leading to a conclusion and therefore should not be set off with commas such as
in these two examples:</p>

<p>His strategy was to impress the boss and <u>thus</u>
receive the promotion.</p>

<p>I was tired and <u>therefore</u> did not want to
go to the party.</p>

<p>In these examples, the transitional words
serve to fully define the meaning of the sentences. There are instances,
however, where a transitional word could be omitted without affecting the
meaning of the sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></strong><br>
I was not confident, <u>however</u>, that he
knew the answer.</p>

<p>The message when on to say, <u>furthermore</u>,
that he would not be coming home for dinner.</p>

<p>The transitional words in these examples
enhance the text by emphasizing the direction in which the meaning of the
sentence is moving. However, the meaning of the sentences would be the same
without the transitional words.</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>To double-check your use of commas
with interjections, identify any word or words that interrupt your sentence and
have little or no effect to the meaning of the sentence. Set these words off
with commas. Next, check for transitional words, keeping in mind the list of
common transitional phrases we discussed earlier. Once you have identified the
transitional words, ask yourself if the words are necessary to convey the
meaning of the sentence. If they are necessary, don&rsquo;t set them off
with commas; if they aren&rsquo;t, use commas.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 5:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a comma and a coordinating
conjunction to join two independent clauses.</p>

<p>An <em>independent clause</em> is
a group of words that contain both a subject and a verb and can stand alone as
a sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  I drove my car to work. (<EM>I</EM>
is the subject, and <em>drove</em> is the verb.)</p>

<p>A <em>coordinating
conjunction</em> is a word that serves as a link between a word or group
of words. These conjunctions are easy to remember by using the acronym BOYFANS:</p>

<p><strong>B</strong>ut</p>

<p><strong>O</strong>r</p>

<p><strong>Y</strong>et</p>

<p><strong>F</strong>or</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>nd</p>

<p><strong>N</strong>or</p>

<p><strong>S</strong>o</p>

<p>Short, choppy sentences can make your writing
tedious to read. To provide some interest and variety to your writing, you will
want to join some of the sentences in your essays. To do so, you will need to
use a comma and a coordinating conjunction. Let&rsquo;s look at some
examples:</p>

<p>Too choppy:</p>

<p>I took a long lunch. I went back to work. I
got behind on my work. I had to stay late.</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<p>I took a long lunch, <u>and</u> I
went back to work. I got behind on my work, <u>so</u> I had to stay
late.</p>

<p>Too choppy:</p>

<p>My guests were arriving in an hour. I wanted
to throw a memorable New Year&rsquo;s Eve party. I made the punch and hors
d&rsquo;oeuvres ahead of time. I found that I still had a lot to get done
to get ready. I decided to put the ice in the punch. Then I discovered that my
icemaker was broken. I didn&rsquo;t have time to go to the store. I wasn&rsquo;t
prepared to serve anything else either. I hurried to the pantry to view my
options. All I had were some tea bags. I decided to throw a New Year&rsquo;s
Eve tea party instead.</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<p>My guests were arriving in an hour, <u>and</u>
I wanted to throw a memorable New Year&rsquo;s Eve party. I made the punch
and hors d&rsquo;oeuvres ahead of time, <u>yet</u> I found that
I still had a lot to get done to get ready. I decided to put the ice in the
punch, <u>but</u> then I discovered that my icemaker was broken. I
didn&rsquo;t have time to go to the store, <u>nor</u> was I
prepared to serve anything else. I hurried to the pantry to view my options.
All I had were some tea bags, <u>so</u> I decided to throw a New
Year&rsquo;s Eve tea party instead.</p>

<p>In both examples, combining sentences with commas and
conjunctions make them more interesting and easier to read. We will learn more
ways to create interest in your writing when we discuss writing style later on.
For now, let&rsquo;s make sure we can apply Rule 5 correctly.</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>To properly combine two independent clauses
with a comma and a conjunction, you must check to make sure that the clauses
joined by the comma and conjunction are indeed independent clauses. To do this,
first find all the conjunctions. Then look at the clauses on either side of
each conjunction. Does each clause have a subject and a verb? Can each clause
stand alone as sentences? If so, the conjunction is properly placed and a comma
should precede the conjunction.</p>

<p>Incorrect:</p>

<p>We went to the mall last night, and bought
some new dresses for work.</p>

<p>Correct:</p>

<p>We went to the mall last night and bought
some new dresses for work.</p>

<p>Correct:</p>

<p>We went to the mall last night, and Terri
bought some new dresses for work.</p>

<p>In the first example, <em>and
</em>is the conjunction. <em>We went to the mall last
night</em> is an independent clause (<em>we </em>is the
subject, <em>went</em> is the verb). However, <em>bought some
new dresses for work</em> is not an independent clause because there is
no subject. Therefore, the sentence can be corrected by simply omitting the
comma as seen in the second example. Or, if there is a possible subject for the
sentence, it can be added and the comma can stay as seen in the third example.
Here is another example where the same guidelines apply:</p>

<p>Incorrect:</p>

<p>He committed the crime, but didn&rsquo;t
think the judge&rsquo;s ruling was fair.</p>

<p>Correct:</p>

<p>He committed the crime but didn&rsquo;t
think the judge&rsquo;s ruling was fair.</p>

<p>Correct:</p>

<p>He committed the crime, but he didn&rsquo;t
think the judge&rsquo;s ruling was fair.</p>

<p>Using a semicolon is another way to correctly
join two independent clauses, and we will discuss it next.</p>
