	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>Geologists in California have
discovered a fault near the famous San Andreas Fault, <u>one that they believe to
be a trigger for</u> major quakes on the San Andreas.</div><div

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect since the relative pronoun <em>that</em> is
redundant: the pronoun <em>one</em>, which refers to the newly
discovered fault, is sufficient.</p>

<p>Although choice (C) reads more smoothly, it still contains
the double pronouns.</p>

<p>Choice (D) is incorrect. Generally, relative pronouns such
as <em>that</em> refer to whole ideas in previous clauses or
sentences. Since the second sentence is about the fault and not its discovery,
the pronoun <em>that</em> is appropriate.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is very tempting. It actually reads better than
choice (A), but it contains a subtle flaw. <em>One</em> is the
direct object of the verb <em>believes</em> and therefore cannot be
the subject of the verb <em>acts</em>. Since <em>they</em>
clearly is not the subject, the verb <em>acts</em> is without a
subject.</p>

<p>Choice (B) has both the correct pronoun and the correct verb
form. <strong>The answer is (B).</p>
