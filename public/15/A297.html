class="solution">Solution:</span></u>Whatever the coordinates of <EM>P</EM>
are, the line <EM>OP</EM> is the hypotenuse of a right triangle
with sides being the absolute value of the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
coordinates. <br>Hence, <EM>OP</EM> is greater than the <em>y</em>-coordinate
of point <EM>P</EM>. <strong>The answer is A</strong>.</p>

<p>This problem brings up the issue of how much you can assume
when viewing a diagram. We are told that <EM>P</EM> is a point in
the coordinate system and that it appears in the second quadrant. Could <EM>P</EM>
be on one of the axes or in another quadrant? No. Although <EM>P</EM>
could be anywhere in Quadrant II (not necessarily where it is displayed), <EM>P</EM>
could not be on the <em>y</em>-axis because the  position of
points, angles, regions, etc. can be assumed to be in the order shown.  If <EM>P</EM>
were on the <em>y</em>-axis, then it would not be to the left of
the <em>y</em>-axis, as it is in the diagram. That is, the order
would be different. [By the way, if <EM>P</EM> could also be on the
axes, the answer would be (D). Why?]</p>
