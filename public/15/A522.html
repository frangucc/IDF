class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>t</em> be time that Steve has been driving. Then issue resolved
<em>t</em> + 1 </span>is time that Richard has been driving. Now, the distance traveled by Steve
is <span class="equation">
<EM>D</EM> = <em>rt</em> = 40<em>t</em></span>,
and Richard&rsquo;s distance is <span class="equation">

60(<em>t</em> + 1)</span>. At the
moment they cross paths, they will have traveled a combined distance of 200
miles. <br>Hence, </p>

<p>40<em>t</em> + 60(<em>t</em> + 1) =
200</p>

<p>40<em>t</em> + 60<em>t</em> + 60 =
200</p>

<p>100<em>t</em> + 60 = 200</p>

<p>100<em>t</em> = 140</p>

<p><em>t</em> = 1.4</p>

<p>Therefore, Steve will have traveled <span class="equation">
<EM>D</EM> =
<em>rt</em> = 40(1.4) = 56 miles</span>. <strong>The answer is
(A).</strong></p>
