<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> Since
<em>y</em> is to be less than 1 and <em>y</em> = &ndash;3<em>x</em>
+ 7, we get </p>

<p>&ndash;3<em>x</em> + 7 < 1</p>

<p>&ndash;3<em>x</em> < &ndash;6 by
subtracting 7 from both sides of the inequality</p>

<p><em>x</em> > 2 by dividing both sides of the
inequality by <span class="equation">&ndash;3</span></p>

<p>(Note that the inequality changes direction when we divide
both sides by a negative number. This is also the case if you multiply both
sides of an inequality by a negative number.)</p>

<p>Since <em>x</em> is an integer and is to be as
small as possible, <em>x</em> = 3. <strong>The answer is
(C).</strong></p>
