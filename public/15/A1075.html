class="solution">Solution:</span>The
second clause states that worldwide steps are being taken to ban plastic. The
word "and" joining the
two clauses of the sentence indicates that the first clause should provide a
reason for the worldwide ban of plastic. The reason is that plastic is proving
to be a menace to the environment. The second blank needs to be filled by a
word that supports the statement and shows the negative consequences of plastic
usage. The suitable word is "non-ecofriendly."
<strong>The answer is (C).</p>
