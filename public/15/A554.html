class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is a hard problem. Let <em>x</em> be the number of people who own
both types of cars. Then the number of people who own only Fords is <span class="equation">
16 &ndash;
<em>x</em></span>, and the number of people who own only Toyotas is 11 &ndash;
<em>x</em>. Adding these two expressions gives the number of people
who own only one of the two types of cars, which we are are told is 15: (16 &ndash;
<em>x</em>) + (11 &ndash; <em>x</em>) = 15. Adding
like terms yields 27 &ndash; 2<em>x</em> = 15. Subtracting 27
from both sides of the equation yields &ndash;2<em>x</em> = &ndash;12.
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by &ndash;2 yields <em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.
<strong>The answer is (B).</strong></p>
