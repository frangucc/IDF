<div class="passage"><p>The premise with which the multiculturalists
begin is unexceptional: that it is important to recognize and to celebrate the
wide range of cultures that exist in the United States. In what sounds like a
reflection of traditional American pluralism, the multiculturalists argue that
we must recognize difference, that difference is legitimate; in its kindlier
versions, multiculturalism represents the discovery on the part of minority
groups that they can play a part in molding the larger culture even as they are
molded by it. And on the campus multiculturalism, defined more locally as the
need to recognize cultural variations among students, has tried with some
success to talk about how a racially and ethnically diverse student body can
enrich everyone&rsquo;s education.</p>

<p>Phillip Green, a political scientist at Smith and a
thoughtful proponent of multiculturalism, notes that for a significant portion
of the students the politics of identity is all-consuming. Students he says "are
unhappy with the thin gruel of rationalism. They require a therapeutic
curriculum to overcome not straightforward racism but ignorant stereotyping."</p>

<p><strong>(1) But</strong> multiculturalism&rsquo;s
hard-liners, who seem to make up the majority of the movement, damn as racism
any attempt to draw the myriad of American groups into a common American
culture. For these multiculturalists, differences are absolute, irreducible,
intractable&mdash;occasions not for understanding but for separation. The
multiculturalist, it turns out, is not especially interested in the great
American hyphen, in the syncretistic (and therefore naturally tolerant)
identities that allow Americans to belong to more than a single culture, to be
both particularists and universalists.</p>

<p>The time-honored American mixture of assimilation and
traditional allegiance is denounced as a danger to racial and gender
authenticity. This is an extraordinary reversal of the traditional liberal
commitment to a "truth"
that transcends parochialisms. In the new race/class/gender formation,
universality is replaced by, among other things, feminist science Nubian
numerals (as part of an Afro-centric science), and what Marilyn Frankenstein of
the University of Massachusetts-Boston describes as "ethno-mathematics,"
in which the cultural basis of counting comes to the fore.</p>

<p>The multiculturalists insist on seeing all perspectives as
tainted by the perceiver&rsquo;s particular point of view. Impartial
knowledge, they argue, is not possible, because ideas are simply the expression
of individual identity, or of the unspoken but inescapable assumptions that are
inscribed in a culture or a language. The problem, <strong>(2)
however,</strong> with this warmed-over Nietzscheanism is that it
threatens to leave no ground for anybody to stand on. So the multi-culturalists
make a leap, necessary for their own intellectual survival, and proceed to
argue that there are some categories, such as race and gender, that do in fact
embody an unmistakable knowledge of oppression. Victims are at least
epistemologically lucky. Objectivity is a mask for oppression. And so an
appalled former 1960s radical complained to me that self-proclaimed witches
were teaching classes on witchcraft. "They&rsquo;re
not teaching students how to think," she said, "they&rsquo;re
telling them what to believe."</p>The author speaks about the "politics
of identity" that Phillip Green, a political
scientist at Smith, notes is all-consuming for many of the students. Considering
the subject of the passage, which one of the following best describes what the
author means by "the politics of identity"?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>The
attempt to discover individual identities through political action</p></li><li><p>The
political agenda that aspires to create a new pride of identity for Americans</p></li><li><p>The
current obsession for therapy groups that help individuals discover their inner
selves</p></li><li><p>The trend among minority students
to discover their identities in their ethnic groups rather than in their
individuality</p></li><li><p>The increased political
activism of minorities on college campuses</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is an extension question. You may find the classification of the these problems
as "application" or "extension"
to be somewhat arbitrary or even disagree with a particular classification. As
mentioned before, application and extension questions differ only in degree. Question
3 is clearly an application question; by asking you to make a conjecture about
the future, it goes well beyond the passage. How to classify Question 4,
however, is not so clear. I classified it as an extension question because it
seems to be asking merely for the author&rsquo;s true meaning of the phrase
"the politics of identity."
That is, it stays within the context of the passage.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be led astray by (B); it uses the word "political"
to tempt you. Although it is perhaps a good description, it is not within the
context of the passage, which focuses on ethnic politics, not national identities
through "roots."
<br><strong>The answer is (D).</strong></p>
