	<div id="question"><p><span class="question">Q. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What is the value of the 201st term of a
sequence if the first term of the sequence is 2 and each successive term is 4
more than the term immediately preceding it?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>798</p></li><li><p>800</p></li><li><p>802</p></li><li><p>804</p></li><li><p>806</p></li></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution: </span>Except
for the first term, each term of the sequence is found by adding 4 to the term
immediately preceding it. In other words, we are simply adding 4 to the
sequence 200 times. This yields</p>

<p><span class="equation">4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;=&nbsp;800</span></p>

<p>Adding the 2 in the first term gives <span class="equation">800 + 2 = 802</span>. <strong>The
answer is (C).</strong></p>

<p>We can also solve this problem formally. The first term of
the sequence is 2, and since each successive term is 4 more than the term
immediately preceding it, the second term is <span class="equation">2 + 4, and the third term is (2 +
4) + 4</span>, and the fourth term is [(2 + 4) + 4] + 4, etc. Regrouping yields (note
that we rewrite the first term as <span class="equation">2 + 4(0)</span>. You&rsquo;ll see why in a
moment.)</p>

<p>2 + 4(0), 2 + 4(1), 2 + 4(2), 2 + 4(3), . . .</p>

<p>Notice that the number within each pair of parentheses is 1
less than the numerical order of the term. For instance, the <em>first</em>
term has a 0 within the parentheses, the <em>second</em> term has a
1 within the parentheses, etc. <br>Hence, the nth term of the sequence is</p>

<p>2 + 4(<em>n </em>&ndash; 1)</p>

<p>Using this formula, the 201st term is <span class="equation">2 + 4(201 &ndash;
1) = 2 + 4(200) = 2 + 800 = 802</span>.</p>
