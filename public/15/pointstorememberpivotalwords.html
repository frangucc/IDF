	<h1>Points to Remember</h1></p>

Pivotal words indicate that the
author is about to make a U-turn in thought or introduce a counter-premise
(concession to a minor point that weakens the argument). 
<ol style="list-style:decimal"> 
</li><li> The following are the most common pivotal words:</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>Although</p>

<p>However</p>

<p>Yet</p>

<p>Despite</p>

<p>Nevertheless</p>

<p>Nonetheless</p>

<p>Except</p>

<p>In contrast</p>

<p>Even though</p>



</li><li> Pivotal words mark natural places for questions to be
drawn. At a pivotal word, the author changes direction. The GRE writers form
questions at these junctures to test whether you made the turn with the author
or whether you continued to go straight. Rarely do the GRE writers pass a
pivotal word without drawing a question from its sentence.

</li><li> As you read each passage, note the pivotal words.</p>
