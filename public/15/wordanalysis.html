	<h1>Word Analysis</h1></p>

<p>In addition to the study of word origin, etymology also
involves word analysis, which is the process of separating a word into its
parts and then using the meanings of those parts to deduce the meaning of the
original word. Take, for example, the word INTERMINABLE. It is made up of three
parts: a prefix IN (not), a root TERMIN (stop), and a suffix ABLE (can do). Therefore,
by word analysis, INTERMINABLE means "not able to
stop." This is not the literal meaning of
INTERMINABLE (endless), but it is close enough to find an antonym. For another
example, consider the word RETROSPECT. It is made up of the prefix RETRO (back)
and the root SPECT (to look). Hence, RETROSPECT means "to
look back (in time), to contemplate."</p>

<p>Word analysis is very effective in decoding the meaning of
words. However, you must be careful in its application since words do not
always have the same meaning as the sum of the meanings of their parts. In
fact, on occasion words can have the opposite meaning of their parts. For
example, by word analysis the word AWFUL should mean "full
of awe," or awe-inspiring. But over the years it
has come to mean just the opposite&mdash;terrible. In spite of the
shortcomings, word analysis gives the correct meaning of a word (or at least a
hint of it) far more often than not and therefore is a useful tool.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
<strong>INDEFATIGABLE</strong></p>

<p>Analysis: IN (not); DE (thoroughly); FATIG (fatigue); ABLE
(can do)</p>

<p>Meaning: cannot be fatigued, tireless</p>

<p><strong>CIRCUMSPECT</strong></p>

<p>Analysis: CIRCUM (around); SPECT (to look)</p>

<p>Meaning: to look around, that is, to be cautious</p>

<p><strong>ANTIPATHY</strong></p>

<p>Analysis: ANTI (against); PATH (to feel); Y (noun suffix)</p>

<p>Meaning: to feel strongly against something, to hate</p>

<p><strong>OMNISCIENT</strong></p>

<p>Analysis: OMNI (all); SCI (to know); ENT (noun suffix)</p>

<p>Meaning: all-knowing</p>
