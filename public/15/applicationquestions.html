	<h1>APPLICATION QUESTIONS</h1></p>

<p>Application questions differ from extension questions only
in degree. Extension questions ask you to apply what you have learned from the
passage to derive new information about the same subject, whereas application
questions go one step further, asking you to apply what you have learned from
the passage to a different or hypothetical situation.</p>

<p>The following are common application questions:</p>

<li><p>Which one of the
following is the most likely source of the passage?</p></li>

<li><p>Which one of the
following actions would be most likely to have the same effect as the author&rsquo;s
actions?</p></li>

<p>You may be asked to complete a thought for the author:</p>

<li><p>The author would most
likely agree with which one of the following statements?</p></li>

<li><p>Which one of the
following sentences would the author be most likely to use to complete the last
paragraph of the passage?</p></li>

<p>To answer an application question, take the author&rsquo;s
perspective. Ask yourself: what am I arguing for? what might make my argument
stronger? what might make it weaker?</p>

<p>Because these questions go well beyond the passage, they
tend to be the most difficult. Furthermore, because application questions and
extension questions require a deeper understanding of the passage, skimming (or
worse yet, speed-reading) the passage is ineffective. Skimming may give you the
main idea and structure of the passage, but it is unlikely to give you the
subtleties of the author&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
<p><strong>Read the passage slowly to get a good understanding of
the issues.</strong></p>

<p>There are two major systems of criminal
procedure in the modern world&mdash;the adversarial and the inquisitorial. The
former is associated with common law tradition and the latter with civil law
tradition. Both systems were historically preceded by the system of private
vengeance in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
administered it privately, either personally or through an agent. The vengeance
system was a system of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
slogan "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
The modern adversarial system is only one historical step removed from the
private vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic features.
Thus, for example, even though the right to institute criminal action has now
been extended to all members of society and even though the police department
has taken over the pretrial investigative functions on behalf of the
prosecution, the adversarial system still leaves the defendant to conduct his
own pretrial investigation. The trial is still viewed as a duel between two
adversaries, refereed by a judge who, at the beginning of the trial has no
knowledge of the investigative background of the case. In the final analysis
the adversarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the
punitive combat.</p>

<p>By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins historically
where the adversarial system stopped its development. It is two historical
steps removed from the system of private vengeance. Therefore, from the
standpoint of legal anthropology, it is historically superior to the
adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the public investigator has
the duty to investigate not just on behalf of the prosecutor but also on behalf
of the defendant. Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to present
to the court not only evidence that may lead to the conviction of the defendant
but also evidence that may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that
both parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence in their
possession. Finally, in an effort to make the trial less like a duel between
two adversaries, the inquisitorial system mandates that the judge take an
active part in the conduct of the trial, with a role that is both directive and
protective.</p>

<p>Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial system. This
system operates on the philosophical premise that in a criminal case the
crucial factor is not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the
goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the court the
commission of the alleged crime.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>(Refer to passage above.)</p>

<p>Based on the information in the passage, it
can be inferred that which one of the following would most logically begin a
paragraph immediately following the passage?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Because
of the inquisitorial system&rsquo;s thoroughness in conducting its pretrial
investigation, it can be concluded that a defendant who is innocent would
prefer to be tried under the inquisitorial system, whereas a defendant who is
guilty would prefer to be tried under the adversarial system.</p></li><li><p>As
the preceding analysis shows, the legal system is in a constant state of flux. For
now the inquisitorial system is ascendant, but it will probably be soon
replaced by another system.</p></li><li><p>The
accusatorial system begins where the inquisitorial system ends. So it is three
steps removed from the system of private vengeance, and therefore historically
superior to it.</p></li><li><p>Because in the
inquisitorial system the judge must take an active role in the conduct of the
trial, his competency and expertise have become critical. </p></li><li><p>The
criminal justice system has evolved to the point that it no longer seems to be
derivative of the system of private vengeance. Modern systems of criminal
justice empower all of society with the right to instigate a legal action, and
the need for vengeance is satisfied through a surrogate&mdash;the public
prosecutor.</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
author has rather thoroughly presented his position, so the next paragraph would
be a natural place for him to summarize it. The passage compares and contrasts
two systems of criminal justice, implying that the inquisitorial system is
superior. We expect the concluding paragraph to sum up this position. Now all
legal theory aside, the system of justice under which an innocent person would
choose to be judged would, as a practical matter, pretty much sum up the
situation. Hence <strong>the answer is (A)</strong>.</p>


<p><strong>Application:
<em>(Mini-passage)</em></strong> </p>

<p>The idea of stuff expresses no more than the experience of
coming to a limit at which our senses or our instruments are not fine enough to
make out the pattern.</p>

<p>Something of the same kind happens when the scientist
investigates any unit or pattern so distinct to the naked eye that it has been
considered a separate entity. He finds that the more carefully he observes and
describes it, the more he is <em>also</em> describing the
environment in which it moves and other patterns to which it seems inseparably
related. As Teilhard de Chardin has so well expressed it, the isolation of
individual, atomic patterns "is merely an
intellectual dodge."</p>

<p>...Although the ancient cultures of Asia never attained the
rigorously exact physical knowledge of the modern West, they grasped in
principle many things which are only now occurring to us. Hinduism and Buddhism
are impossible to classify as religions, philosophies, sciences, or even
mythologies, or again as amalgamations of all four, because departmentalization
is foreign to them even in so basic a form as the separation of the spiritual
and the material.... Buddhism ... is not a culture but a critique of culture,
an enduring nonviolent revolution, or "loyal
opposition," to the culture with which it is
involved. This gives these ways of liberation something in common with
psychotherapy beyond the interest in changing states of consciousness. For the
task of the psychotherapist is to bring about a reconciliation between
individual feeling and social norms without, however, sacrificing the integrity
of the individual. He tries to help the individual to be himself and to go it
alone in the world (of social convention) but not of the world.</p>

<p></strong>What does the passage suggest about the theme
of the book from which it is excerpted?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>The
book attempts to understand psychotherapy in the context of different and
changing systems of thought.</p></li><li><p>The book
argues that psychotherapy unites elements of an exact science with elements of
eastern philosophy.</p></li><li><p>The book describes
the origins of psychotherapy around the world.</p></li><li><p>The
book compares psychotherapy in the West and in the East.</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span><strong>(A):Yes,</strong> this is the most accurate inference from the passage. The
passage discusses how the more carefully a scientist views and describes
something the more he describes the environment in which it moves, and the
passage traces similarities between psychotherapy and Eastern systems of
(evolving) thought. (B): No, this is too narrow an interpretation of what the
whole book would be doing. (C): No, too vague; the passage is too philosophical
to be merely a history. (D): No, also too vague, meant to entrap those of you
who relied on the title without thinking through the passage.<strong></p>
