	<h1>How to Get a "Top-Half" Score</h1></p>

<p>Writing essays for standardized exams can raise anxieties in
people who are poised when answering other kinds of test questions. Perhaps
this is because critical and creative skills are being tested and evaluated in
a more subjective manner than they are within the objective multiple-choice
format. Performance anxiety can lead to a host of problems, from having a
difficult time understanding exactly what is being asked to having debilitating
uncertainties about how to begin an answer.</p>

<p>The best way to reduce such anxieties, and therefore
increase your chance of obtaining a top-half score, is through <em>rehearsal</em>,
which encompasses four activities that need to take place before taking the
GRE:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal"><li><p> understanding the two writing tasks and how they differ</p></li>

<li><p>knowing what the evaluators expect to find in top-half
essays</p></li>

<li><p>anticipating an organizational scheme for each of the two
essays</p></li>

<li><p>writing out at least one answer for each of the two
question types</p></li></ol>

<p>Having completed these four steps, you will
be in an excellent position to approach the Analytical Writing Test with
confidence and competency. </p>
