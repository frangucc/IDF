class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are consecutive integers, one
of them must be even. <br>Hence, the product <em>xy</em> is even and
Statement I is true. As to Statement II, suppose <em>z</em> is odd,
then <em>x</em> must be odd as well. Now, the difference of two odd
numbers is an even number. <br>Next, suppose <em>z</em> is even, then <em>x</em>
must be even as well. Now, the difference of two even numbers is again an even
number. <br>Hence, Statement II is true. As to Statement&nbsp;III, let <span class="equation"><em>x</em>
= 1</span>, then <em>z</em> = 3 and <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup><em>z</em></sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</span>, which is odd. Thus, Statement III is
not necessarily true. <strong>The answer is (D).</strong></p>
