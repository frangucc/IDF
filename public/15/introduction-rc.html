	<h1>Introduction</h1></p>

<p><strong></p>

<p></strong>The verbal section of the GRE contains two to
four passages, with about eight questions among them. The subject matter of a
passage can be almost anything, but the most common themes are politics,
history, culture, and science.</p>

<p>Most people find the passages difficult because the subject
matter is dry and unfamiliar. Obscure subject matter is chosen so that your
reading comprehension will be tested, not your knowledge of a particular
subject. Also the more esoteric the subject the more likely everyone taking the
test will be on an even playing field. However, because the material must still
be accessible to laymen, you won&rsquo;t find any tracts on subtle issues
of philosophy or abstract mathematics. In fact, if you read books on current
affairs and the Op/Ed page of the newspaper, then the style of writing used in
the GRE passages will be familiar and you probably won&rsquo;t find the
reading comprehension particularly difficult. </p>

<p>The passages use a formal, compact style. They are typically
taken from articles in academic journals, but they are rarely reprinted verbatim.
Usually the chosen article is heavily edited until it is honed down to about
300 to 600 words. The formal style of the piece is retained but much of the "fluff"
is removed. The editing process condenses the article to about one-third its
original length. Thus, a GRE passage contains about three times as much
information for its length as does the original article. This is why the
passages are similar to the writing on the Op/Ed page of a newspaper. After
all, a person writing a piece for the Op/Ed page must express all his ideas in
about 500 words, and he must use a formal (grammatical) style to convince
people that he is well educated.</p>

<p>In addition to being dry and unfamiliar, GRE passages often
start in the middle of an explanation, so there is no point of reference. Furthermore,
the passages are untitled, so you have to hit the ground running.</p>
