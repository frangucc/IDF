	<h1>A Biography of English</h1></p>

<p>It is helpful to learn some of the history of English&mdash;a
language less than 2000 years old that has made its way to almost every corner
of the world, making it the one true global language. Knowing something about
the history of the language as well as its present qualities should not only
intrigue you, but also give you more facility to acquire new vocabulary and use
it well in your graduate work.</p>

<p>It has been said that English came to Britain "on
the edge of a sword." In 449 AD, Britain, at the
time settled by the Celts, became the target of several invasions because other
groups of people wanted its fertile land. The first group of people to invade,
the Anglo-Saxons, drove the Celtic-Britons westward, settled into the fertile
land, and began farming their new property. The Anglo-Saxons were an
agricultural people; everyday words like <em>sheep</em>, <em>shepherd</em>,
<em>ox</em>, <em>earth</em>, <em>dog</em>, <em>wood</em>,
<em>field</em>, and <em>work</em> come from the
Anglo-Saxon Old English. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to write a modern
English sentence without using Anglo-Saxon words like <em>the</em>,
<em>is</em>, <em>you</em>, <em>here</em>,
and <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>The Vikings built on the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary with their
merciless invasions. During the time of the Viking invasions, Anglo-Saxon
writing reflected a bitter, negative tone. Themes like transience of life,
heroism, and keeping dignity in the face of defeat permeated their writings
about themes such as the cruel sea, ruined cities, war, and exile. One notable
example of Old English writing is the heroic epic poem <em>Beowulf</em>.
Lines 20-25 of the Prologue in Old English read:</p>

<p> Swa sceal geong guma gode gewyrcean,</p>

<p> fromum feohgiftum on f der bearme,</p>

<p> p t hine on ylde eft gewunigen</p>

<p> wilgesipas, ponne wig cume,</p>

<p> leode gel sten; lofd dum sceal</p>

<p> in m gpa gehw re man gepeon.</p>

<p>These lines are translated as follows:</p>

<p> So becomes it a youth to quit him well</p>

<p> with his father&rsquo;s friends, by fee and gift,</p>

<p> that to aid him, aged, in after days,</p>

<p> come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,</p>

<p> liegemen loyal; by lauded deeds</p>

<p> shall an earl have honor in every clan.</p>

<p>Most likely, you found it impossible to interpret even one
word of the poem as it was originally written; Old English was certainly very
different from English as we know it today.</p>

<p>It would take yet another invasion to add just a bit of
present-day "normalcy"
to the language. This invasion came in 1066 and became known as the Norman
Conquest. It transformed the English language, marking a turning point in the
language&rsquo;s history from Old English to Middle English. When the
Normans invaded Britain from present-day Normandy, France, and William the
conqueror took the throne, English began its transformation into the melting
pot of all languages.</p>

<p>When the Normans arrived in Britain, they found a people
governed by what they considered to be inferior moral and cultural standards.
Consequently, French was the language of the aristocrats, the well-bred&mdash;the
language of the civilized. However, English survived for a number of reasons.
First and foremost, it was too established to disappear. In addition, there was
intermarriage between the French-speaking Normans and the English-speaking
Anglos, and, in instances where an Anglo woman married a Norman, the children
were more likely to speak their mother&rsquo;s language, thus carrying the
language to the next generation.</p>

<p>Other events had an effect on the strength of English as
well. The Hundred Years War caused French to lose its prestige while it
bolstered nationalism for English. During the war, the Black Plague took so
many lives that labor was scarce, forcing the rise of the English working man.
The disease had the same effect in churches and monasteries.</p>

<p>Through the survival of English came many changes to its
vocabulary and to its written form. The biggest change was the addition of many
borrowed words, especially from French and Latin. Although English borrowed
many words from French, French had little impact on the grammatical structure of
the language, though there were notable changes to its form. For example,
pronunciations and spelling changed as regional dialects formed. In addition,
word order began to change. Through all the changes, English began to take on
more of the look that we recognize today although there were still marked
differences. Following is an excerpt from the Prologue of Chaucer&rsquo;s <em>Canterbury
Tales</em>. Try deciphering the left column without consulting the
translation in the right column.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, you found <em>Canterbury Tales</em>
easier to decipher than <em>Beowulf</em>, even in its original
form. Clearer still is the following well-known excerpt from William
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>:</p>

<p> O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?</p>

<p> Deny thy father and refuse thy name!</p>

<p> Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,</p>

<p> And I&rsquo;ll no longer be a Capulet. <em>(2.2.33-36)</em></p>

<p>William Shakespeare along with King James marked the change
from Middle English to Modern English although their writing reflected a use of
word order that still sounds awkward in our present-day English. For example,
the King James version of the Bible uses such phrases as <em>follow thou
me</em>, <em>speak ye unto me</em>, <em>cake
unleavened</em>, <em>things eternal</em>, <em>they knew
him not</em>. Although these authors&rsquo; writings may seem
antiquated to us today, they both have left a lasting impression. Many
present-day phrases came from Shakespeare: <em>good riddance</em>, <em>lie
low</em>, <em>the long and the short of it</em>, <em>a
fool&rsquo;s paradise</em>, <em>sleep a wink</em>, <em>green-eyed
jealousy</em>, and <em>love at first sight</em>. King James
contributed many of today&rsquo;s idioms: <em>the root of the
matter</em>, <em>wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing</em>, <em>lambs
to the slaughter</em>, <em>an eye for an eye</em>, and <em>straight
and narrow</em>.</p>

<p>In comparison, English as Shakespeare and King James knew it
and English as we know it is quite different. Truly, English is a changing
language. And, although it seems to have already had a very full life, there is
no reason to assume that it will not continue to pass through new and different
stages in its life.</p>

<p><strong>The Birth of a Word</strong></p>

<p>Just as the English language was born and has lived a life
of change, so too a word has a life. From its birth, a word can undergo changes
or remain static throughout its life; it may seem immortal, or it may die.
Words have ancestors; they have relatives. Words also have "friends"
(<em>synonyms</em>) and "enemies"
(<em>antonyms</em>). Studying the life of words is fascinating and
gives you an upper hand at understanding and using words and deciphering
unfamiliar words you may find on the GRE or in your graduate work.<strong></strong></p>

<p>A word&rsquo;s ancestor is called a <em>cognate</em>.
Cognates are ancient words that bare a close resemblance to modern words. For
example, in ancient Indo-European Sanskrit the word <em>father</em>
is "pitar;" in Latin, "pater;"
in French, "p re;" in
Spanish "padre." In
Sanskrit, <em>mother</em> is "matar;"
in Latin, "mater;" in
French, "m re;" in
Spanish, "madre." Sir
William Jones, a British judge, was the first to point out the close
relationship between languages despite the passage of time. His theory, a
theory shared by many today, was that the languages of 1/3 of the human race
have a common source in this Indo-European language.</p>

<p>This common source found in cognates should not be confused
with borrowed words. Borrowing is one way that words are given birth in the
English language. English has borrowed more words than any other language,
especially from French and Latin&mdash;a direct result from the Norman
Conquest. Borrowed words sometimes keep their original form. For example, the
French word <em>laissez-faire</em> is commonly used in English and
refers to the "policy of non-interference,
especially as pertaining to government." In other
instances, however, words change form to fit the accepted rules and
pronunciation that govern the English language. For example, the word <em>adroit</em>
means "right, justice."
The word is from the French <em> </em>, which means "to"
and <em>droit</em> (pronounced <em>dwa</em>), which
means "right." Through
their transition to English, the words changed spelling to become one word, the
English version lost the accent mark, and the pronunciation changed. Following
are some examples of other borrowed words:</p>

<p><strong>ABERRATION</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: departure from what is normal</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>aberrare</em>, to wander
away from</p>

<p>Details of origin: Originally a psychological term
describing a person who mentally deviates from the norm.</p>

<p><strong>ABOMINATE</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: loathe</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>abominor</em>, "I
pray that the event predicted by the omen may be averted"</p>

<p>Details of origin: A superstitious word the Romans uttered
to ward off evil spirits when anyone said something unlucky. </p>

<p><strong>ALOOF</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: distant (as pertaining to emotion)</p>

<p>Derived from: Dutch <em>te loef</em>, to
windward; also used as a sailor&rsquo;s term <em>a loof</em>,
to the luff or windward direction</p>

<p>Details of origin: Present meaning suggests that the use of
the term to mean "keeping a ship&rsquo;s head
to the wind and away from the shore" developed into
our meaning of "distance."</p>

<p><strong>EBULLIENT</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: high-spirited; exuberant</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>ebullire</em>, to boil
over</p>

<p>Details of origin: Much as a pot boils over, one who is
ebullient "boils over"
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p><strong>EXPUNGE</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: erase; remove</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>expungere</em>, to prick
through or mark off</p>

<p>Details of origin: In ancient Rome, when a soldier would
retire, a series of dots and points were placed under his name on service
lists.</p>

<p><strong>GREGARIOUS</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: sociable</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>gregarius</em> and <em>grex</em>,
flock or herd</p>

<p>Details of origin: From the idea that animals stayed in
flocks or herds because they were sociable came our present-day meaning.</p>

<p><strong>LETHARGY</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: drowsiness; sluggishness</p>

<p>Derived from: Greek <em>lethargia</em> or <em>lethe</em>,
forgetfulness</p>

<p>Details of origin: Because of the Greeks belief in
afterlife, legend had it that the dead crossed the river Lethe, which took them
through Hades. Anyone who drank from the river would forget his past. This idea
of forgetfulness lead to our meaning of sluggishness.</p>

<p>While some words are borrowed directly from another
language, others are adopted from interesting people and events in history. For
example, you have probably at one time or another made a <em>Freudian
slip</em>, an unintentional comment based on some subconscious feeling.
And did you know that a <em>bootlegger</em> was originally someone
who smuggled illegal alcoholic liquor in the tops of his boots? Here are some
other words with fascinating histories:</p>

<p><strong>AMALGAM</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: mixture, combination</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>amalgama</em>, alloy of
mercury; Greek <em>malagma</em>, softening substance</p>

<p>Details of origin: Evolved to present meaning in 1775.</p>

<p><strong>BOWDLERIZE</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: to remove offensive words from a book</p>

<p>Derived from: Scottish physician Dr. Thomas Bowdler</p>

<p>Details of origin: Dr. Bowdler published an edition of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s works, omitting certain words which he deemed
offensive. </p>

<p><strong>CHAUVINISM</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: exaggerated patriotism</p>

<p>Derived from: one of Napoleon&rsquo;s soldiers, Nicolas
Chauvin</p>

<p>Details of origin: After retiring from the army, Chauvin
spoke so highly of himself and his feats while in battle that he became a joke
and thus the term was coined.</p>

<p><strong>CYNOSURE</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: center of attention or admiration</p>

<p>Derived from: Greek mythology <em>Cynosura</em>,
dog&rsquo;s tail</p>

<p>Details of origin: The Greek god Zeus honored a nymph by
placing her as a constellation in the sky. One star in the constellation in
particular stood out. To many, the constellation looked like a dog&rsquo;s
tail because of the one bright star.</p>

<p><strong>DESULTORY</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: lacking in consistency; disconnected</p>

<p>Derived from: Romans <em>desultor</em>, a leaper</p>

<p>Details of origin: Often Roman soldiers would go into battle
with two horses so that when one horse tired, the soldier could leap to the
second horse striding alongside. This person became known as a <em>desultor</em>,
or leaper. The term evolved since this leaper only stayed on one horse for a
short amount of time before becoming disconnected and jumping to the other
horse.</p>

<p><strong>FIASCO</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: humiliating failure or breakdown</p>

<p>Derived from: Italian <em>fiasco</em>, flask or
bottle</p>

<p>Details of origin: Venetian glassblowers set aside fine
glass with flaws to use in making ordinary bottles. The term resulted from the
fact that something fine should be turned into something ordinary.</p>

<p><strong>GAMUT</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: whole series or range of something</p>

<p>Derived from: medieval musician Guido of Arezzo</p>

<p>Details of origin: Arezzo was the first to use the lines of
the musical staff, and he assigned the Greek letter "gamma"
for the lowest tone. This note was called "gamma ut"
and thus "gamut"
evolved into our present meaning.</p>

<p><strong>INTRANSIGENT</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: uncompromising</p>

<p>Derived from: Spanish <em>intransigente</em>,
not compromising</p>

<p>Details of origin: In 1873, Amadeus was forced to give up
the throne of Spain. After this occurred, a group of people attempted to form a
political party of their own. This group was known as <em>los
intransigentes</em> because they would not conform to the policies of any
other groups.</p>

<p><strong>JOVIAL</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: merry</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>Jovialis</em>, of
Jupiter; <em>Jovius</em>, Jupiter</p>

<p>Details of origin: Astrologers believed that those born
under the sign of Jupiter were characterized by a merry disposition.</p>

<p><strong>MESMERIZE</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: fascinate; spellbind</p>

<p>Derived from: Austrian doctor Friedrich Anton Mesmer</p>

<p>Details of origin: Doctor Mesmer was the first to
successfully use hypnotism. Although the term is still used today to relate to
the technique of hypnotism, its meaning has broadened to encompass a general
idea of fascination.</p>

<p><strong>OSTRACIZE</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: to exclude from a society as by general
consent</p>

<p>Derived from: Greek <em>ostrakon</em>, tile,
shell</p>

<p>Details of origin: In ancient Greece, if a man was
considered dangerous to society, judges would cast their votes regarding
banishment by writing their names on a tile and dropping them in an urn.</p>

<p><strong>QUARANTINE</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: isolation to prevent contagion</p>

<p>Derived from: Latin <em>quadraginta</em>, forty
and <em>quattuor</em>, four; <em>quarantina</em>, space
of forty days</p>

<p>Details of origin: This word has a rich history, originally
referring to the period of time that a widow in the 1500&rsquo;s could live
in her dead husband&rsquo;s house. It was also used to reference the period
of 40 days during which Christ fasted in the wilderness. In the 1600&rsquo;s,
the Venetians kept ships at bay for 40 days if their voyage originated in a
disease-stricken country. Since then, the term has broadened to encompass any
period of isolation.</p>

<p><strong>QUISLING</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: traitor</p>

<p>Derived from: Norweigan army officer Vidkun Quisling</p>

<p>Details of origin: Although the term loosely refers to a
traitor, more specifically it describes a traitor who betrays his country to
serve a dictatorial government. Officer Quisling was one such traitor who
betrayed Norway to join arms with the Nazis in World War II.</p>

<p><strong>SYCOPHANT</strong></p>

<p>Present meaning: self-seeking flatterer</p>

<p>Derived from: Greek <em>sykon</em>, fig; <em>phantes</em>,
one who shows</p>

<p>Details of origin: Originally, a sycophant referred to an
informer. Etymologists speculate that the term "fig-shower"
was used in this context because ancient Greeks, or sycophants, would act as
informers against merchants who were unlawfully exporting figs.</p>

<p>The process by which a word comes into being is called <em>neologism</em>
or <em>coinage</em>. A new word is coined when it is used by a
large number of people for a significant amount of time. Though not a very
specific and measurable process, it is clearer when we look at three main
reasons people begin using new words. First, new words are created when two
words are combined into one. For example, the word <em>breakfast</em>
evolved from the two words <em>break</em> and <em>fast</em>.
Breakfast "breaks" the "fast"
your body undergoes during the night. Other words like <em>roommate</em>,
<em>housewife</em>, <em>stay-at-home</em>,<em>
</em>and<em> doorbell</em> were coined by the same process of
combining multiple words to form one.</p>

<p>The opposite process also forms new words. For example, the
word <em>ref</em> is short for <em>referee</em>; <em>gym</em>
is short for <em>gymnasium</em>; and <em>exam</em> is
short for <em>examination</em>. It is easy to imagine how shortened
words become coined&mdash;as a society, we are always looking for
shortcuts, and clipping words is a convenient shortcut.</p>

<p>New words are also coined to avoid confusion, most often
between languages. For example, have you ever wondered exactly where the tennis
term <em>love</em> came from? It seems a strange term to use for
scoring. Tennis is originally a French game, and since a zero is egg-shaped,
the French referred to it as <em>l&rsquo; uf</em>. This term
was confused in translation and only the pronunciation was adopted;
English-speakers heard "love"
and it stuck. Another example of confusion is the word <em>maudlin</em>,
which means "tearfully sentimental."
The word evolved from the British English pronunciation of "Mary
Magdalene." During the Middle Ages, one of the
popular plays depicted the life of the Bible&rsquo;s Mary Magdalene.
Because the character was usually tearful in every scene and, because the
British pronunciation was "Maudlin,"
the term picked up this meaning.</p>

<p><strong>The Life of a Word</strong></p>

<p>Whatever the birth story, some words live exciting lives of
change while others retain their original meaning. Words can undergo changes by
being clipped as mentioned above or by being combined with other words to form
completely new ones. Some words become more powerful. For example, the words <em>filth</em>
and <em>foul</em> were originally used to mean plain old "dirt."
Originally, you might wipe down your kitchen counter at the end of the day
because it was <em>filthy</em> or <em>foul</em>. Today <em>filthy</em>
and <em>foul</em> have taken on a more powerful meaning so that you
probably only associate <em>filth</em> and <em>foul</em>
with the nearest garbage dump. Another example of a word that has gained force
is <em>disaster</em>. At one time, the word simply referred to "an
unlucky event." Today, we hear the word used in
reference to "disaster areas"
resulting from earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes. There is much more power
associated with the word now.</p>

<p>Words can also lose power. Take the word <em>mortify</em>,
for example. It originally meant "to make dead."
Now it can simply refer to a moment of humiliation: He was <em>mortified</em>
when he realized that his zipper was down during his important speech. Other
words have powerful meanings, even as depicted in the dictionary, but in
everyday speech they are used rather casually. For example, the word <em>atrocious</em>
by definition refers to something that is "extremely
savage or wicked." But you&rsquo;ve probably
heard the word in reference to someone&rsquo;s taste in style: Did you see
that <em>atrocious</em> purple and green striped dress she was
wearing?</p>

<p>Words gain power and they lose power. Words can also gain or
lose a bad reputation. The word <em>lewd</em> has gained a negative
connotation over the years from its original reference to all laymen. From
there it evolved to present-day where it now encompasses things that are "indecent
or obscene." On the other hand, <em>marshal</em>
once referred to a person who took care of horses. Over the years, the position
gained more respect and now not only refers to the person who controls parades,
but also refers to someone in a high-ranking position such as a sheriff.</p>

<p>In both the example of <em>lewd</em> and the
example of <em>marshal</em>, not only did the meanings change from
positive to negative and vice versa, but they also changed in scope. <em>Lewd</em>
became more narrow in its meaning, <em>marshal</em> more broad. <em>Butcher</em>
is another example of a word that has broadened in scope. A butcher was
originally a man who killed goats. Nowadays, you can expect to find a vast
array of meats in a butcher shop. By contrast, the original meaning of <em>disease</em>
was "ill at ease." The
word has narrowed its scope over the years so that now it refers to specific
ailments and maladies.</p>

<p>What a boring language we would speak if words did not
change in so many different ways! And how mundane our speech would be if it were
not colored with such flourishes as slang and colloquialisms. The word <em>slang</em>
was coined by combining the word <em>slinging</em> with the word <em>language</em>.
Specific to certain countries, even just to particular regions of a country,
slang refers to very informal language. Slang should therefore not be used in
your graduate classes. Slang generally stays with the time and examples include
such words as <em>yuppie</em>, <em>valleygirl</em>, and
<em>phat</em>. Slang can also include standard words that portray
alternate, often ironic, meanings; for example, the word <em>bad</em>
when used as slang can describe something that is actually good. Think of slang
as language you would use only when you are <em>chillin&rsquo;</em>
(slang for "spending time with")
with your closest friends </p>

<p><em>Colloquialisms</em> are also informal although
they are more widely accepted. Still, you should not use colloquial speech in
your graduate work. You could use colloquial language with those with whom you
are close but perhaps not quite as familiar as your best buddies&mdash;your
parents, for example. Instead of <em>chillin&rsquo;</em> with
your family, you might <em>hang out</em> with them. Or you might
tell a co-worker to <em>give you a holler</em> if he wants to get
together for lunch. Clearly, knowing your audience is important when choosing
the language you will use. Since your work on the GRE and in graduate school is
for a formal audience, formal language should be favored; avoid slang and colloquialisms.</p>

<p>You should also avoid overusing <em>euphemisms</em>,
or "delicate" language.
In our world of political correctness, there is a natural tendency to
substitute "nice" words
for real words. For example, you might describe a "domestic
engineer" who is "with
child." Translation? A pregnant housewife. The best
writing conveys a real point clearly and therefore euphemisms should be used
sparingly.</p>

<p>While slang, colloquialism, and euphemism, though informal,
are ways to bring the personality of a writer or speaker out in the open, a
more subtle way to express such character is through connotative writing. In
comparison to denotative language, connotative words possess undertones of
emotion. Denotation is factual. Take the word <em>gentleman</em>,
for example. <em>Gentleman</em> is a connotative word that contains
much more meaning than does the denotative word <em>man</em>. To
picture a man is just to picture a male human. But to picture a gentleman is to
imagine a well-dressed man who brings flowers, opens doors, and pulls out
chairs for his lady. And of course a lady is not just a woman but a
sophisticated female who is elegant and courteous, who quietly laughs at the right
time and crosses her legs when she sits down. A lady is <em>lovely</em>
(connotative), not just <em>pretty</em> (denotative).</p>

<p><strong>How Words Die</strong></p>

<p>Although certain words are seemingly immortal like <em>and</em>,
<em>the</em>, and <em>is</em>, others do meet their
death. When a word meets its death, it becomes <em>obsolete</em>.
The King James version of the Bible as well as any one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays contains a vast sum of words that, today, are obsolete. Slang words and
colloquialisms are also quick to become obsolete. This is because slang and
colloquialisms generally come into existence through trends. Speaking trends
fade in and fade out just as quickly as the latest fashion trends.</p>

<p>Some words do not fade away, but their meaning does. A
well-known example of such a phenomenon is the word <em>gay</em>,
which at one time meant "happy."
Today the word is used in reference to homosexuality. And did you know that <em>nice</em>
originally referred to something that was "silly"
or "foolish"? Other
meanings of words are surely on their way out as technology advances. For
example, very few people actually "dial"
a number into their phone because there are few rotary phones still in use.
Along the same lines, singers no longer put out "albums"
because we now have compact discs rather than records. It is probably just a
matter of time until these meanings die.</p>

<p>When you study the life of a word, it is easy to see that
English is truly a unique language. Studying its history, its life, and its
patterns is both fascinating and helpful in learning to communicate
effectively. Excelling in your use of the English language in graduate school
will contribute greatly to your success. Success in graduate school will lead
to success in your career which is your ultimate goal. Knowing this should make
you all the more diligent in your study of English and the words that make up
the one true global language.</p>
