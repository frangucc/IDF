class="solution">Solution:</span>We
are given that set <EM>A</EM> contains 8 elements and set <EM>B</EM>
contains just 3 elements, so the greatest possible number of elements common to
set <EM>A</EM> and set <EM>B</EM> is 3. There are 5
more elements in set <EM>A</EM> than in set <EM>B</EM>,
so there are at least 5 elements in set <EM>A</EM> that cannot be
in set <EM>B</EM>. <br>Hence, Column B is always larger than
Column&nbsp;A. <strong>The answer is (B).</strong></p>
