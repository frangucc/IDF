Volume of a cylinder with a height of 10</p>

<p><strong>Column B</strong><br>
Volume of a cone with a height of 10</p>

</ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Since we are not given the radius of
the cylinder, we can make the cylinder very narrow or very broad by taking the
radius to very small or very large. The same can be done with the cone. <br>Hence,
we have a double case, and <strong>the answer is D</strong>.</p>
