	<h1>Antonyms I</h1></p>



<p>There are about 9 antonyms on the verbal section of the
test. The questions are mixed in with the analogies, sentence completions, and
reading comprehension. An antonym will often begin the verbal section.</p>

<p>Antonyms are probably the hardest type of question to
improve on since increasing one&rsquo;s vocabulary is a long-term project. Nevertheless,
we will study some very effective techniques that can be applied to these problems.</p>

<p>However, don&rsquo;t rely on just these techniques -- as
we mentioned at the beginning of the verbal section, you must study word lists.
Obviously, you cannot attempt to memorize the dictionary, and you don&rsquo;t
need to. The GRE tests a surprisingly limited number of words. At the end of
the verbal portion of this app, you will find a list of 4000 essential words. Granted,
memorizing a list of words is rather dry, but it is probably the most effective
way of improving your performance on the verbal section. While you are studying
the verbal techniques, you should also be studying the word lists. It&rsquo;s
not as daunting as it appears: you will know many of the words or at least be
familiar with them. And if you don&rsquo;t know them, there are some
techniques to learn new words that will simplify the process. Everyone learns
differently, so choose the technique that works best for you.</p>
