	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p><u>Most of the homes that were
destroyed in last summer&rsquo;s brush fires were</u> built with wood-shake

of the homes that were destroyed in last summer&rsquo;s brush fires had

fires destroyed last summer&rsquo;s have been</p></li><li><p>Most

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect because the simple past <em>were</em> does not
express the fact that the homes had been built before the fire destroyed them. </p>

<p>Choice (B) merely rearranges the wording while retaining the
simple past <em>were</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (C) is the correct
answer</strong> because it uses the past perfect <em>had
been</em> to indicate that the homes were completely built before they
were destroyed by the fires.</p>

<p>Choice (D) is incorrect because it uses the present perfect <em>have
been</em>, which implies that the homes were destroyed before being
built.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is incorrect. Although dropping the phrase <em>that</em>
<em>were</em> makes the sentence more concise, the past progressive
<em>were being</em> implies that the homes were destroyed while
being built.<strong></p>
