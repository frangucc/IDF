	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Column
A: Since the given series of numbers are in arithmetic progression, the mean
will be the middle number in the series. The mean of the series is 17 since it
is the middle number.</p>

<p>Column B: Since the given series of numbers are also in
arithmetic progression, the mean will be the middle number in the series. The
mean of the series is 17 since it is the middle number.</p>

<p>Hence, the values in the columns A and B are same. <strong>The
answer is (C).</strong></p>
