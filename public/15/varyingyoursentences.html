  <h1>Varying Your Sentences</h1>
    <p>No matter how well your essay
flows, the reader will easily get bored if your essay consists only of
sentences that contain the same words and follow the same structure. Consider
this paragraph:</p>

<p>Dogs are smarter than cats. They are often
used to help handicapped people. Dogs help blind people. Dogs also help
epileptic people. Dogs can sense when an epileptic person is about to have a
seizure. Dogs are also used in rescue work. They help rescue skiers. They also
help in catastrophic events. They rescue people after earthquakes.</p>

<p>There are several things wrong with this
paragraph:</p>

<ul><li> Almost every sentence is the same length.</li>
<li> The structure in each sentence is almost
identical: Subject + Verb + Direct Object.</li>
<li>The same words are used over and over: "dogs,"
"they," "also,"
"help," "rescue."</li>
<li> No description is used to further
illustrate the writer&rsquo;s points.</li></ul>

<p>To add more interest to your writing, you need to vary your
sentence length and structure. Try different beginnings for your sentences.
Employ a variety of words and use these words to paint a vivid picture of your
subject. Let&rsquo;s apply these tips to the paragraph above:</p>

<p>Dogs are more intelligent than your average
feline. A cat cannot, for example, guide a blind person across busy streets and
along crowded sidewalks. Amazingly enough, a dog is also a perfect companion
for a person with epilepsy because a dog seems to be able to sense when a
seizure is coming on. While dogs help keep the handicapped away from danger,
they also aid in rescuing people who have fallen victim to dangerous
situations, like skiers trapped in an avalanche. Moreover, when catastrophic
events, like earthquakes, leave victims pinned beneath debris and rubble, a
canine team often comes to the rescue.</p>

<p>A good way to vary your sentences is to begin
them in different ways. For example, you could begin your sentence with the
subject and predicate and then build on them using various words and phrases.
This type of sentence is called a <em>cumulative sentence. </em>By
contrast, in a <em>periodic sentence,</em> you use words and
phrases to build up to the subject and the predicate at the end of the
sentence. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Cumulative sentence:</p>

<p>The energetic children played hard, chasing
each other in all directions, occasionally falling and then scrambling to their
feet, giggling at each other&rsquo;s antics and never stopping for even a
moment to catch their breath.</p>

<p>Periodic sentence:</p>

<p>With flour in her hair, dough in between her
fingers and sauce all over her face, she attempted to make a gourmet pizza.</p>

<p>Both types of sentences not only add variety,
but also bring rhythm and cadence to writing. This rhythm creates interest and
is pleasant to the reader. Additionally, descriptive words paint a clear
picture for the reader.</p>

<p><u>Figurative Language</u></strong></p>

<p>Another excellent way to paint vivid pictures for your
reader is to use figures of speech. Figures of speech&mdash;like similes,
metaphors, analogies, personification, hyperbole, irony, and allusion&mdash;when
used correctly, add extra flair to your writing. They add to your style of
writing an element that takes your writing from ordinary to extraordinary.</p>

<p><u>Similes</u> show a marked
comparison between two things by using the phrases "like,"
"as," or "as
if."</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>The cat stood poised and still as a statue,
waiting for the opportune moment to pounce.</p>

<p>Here the cat is described "as
a statue" because it is standing so still.</p>

<p><u>Metaphors</u> show absolute
comparison by omitting "like,"
"as," or "as
if."</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  She is Mother Theresa when it comes to her
generosity and compassion.</p>

<p>Here the comparison is absolute because the
writer states that this person <em>is</em> Mother Theresa; the
writer does not say that this person is just <em>like</em> Mother
Theresa.</p>

<p><u>Analogies</u> compare the
similar features of two dissimilar things. Analogies often bring clarity to
writing by showing a reader another way of seeing something. Analogies are not
limited to a sentence; sometimes an analogy streams its way through an entire
piece of writing.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Office cooperation is like a soccer game.
Each employee has a position on the playing field, and each position dictates
an employee&rsquo;s function. Working together, the office completes passes
by communicating well within each department. Shots on goal are taken when
employees meet with prospective clients to pitch ideas. And the whole office
triumphs when a goal is scored and a prospect becomes a client.</p>

<p>Here one element, an office working together,
is compared to another, a soccer team playing a game. Although an office and a
soccer team are two very unrelated things, the writer sees similarities in some
aspects between the two and uses these similarities to show more clearly how an
office works together.</p>

<p><u>Personification</u> gives
human characteristics to animals, inanimate objects and ideas in order to make
them more real and understandable.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The rusty car groaned, coughed, then gave one
last sputter and died.</p>

<p>The car in this sentence comes to life even
as it "dies" because of
the human characteristics it is given.</p>

<p><u>Hyperbole</u> uses deliberate
exaggeration or overstatement to show special emphasis or create humor.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Fat-free foods have become so popular that
soon all vendors will want to give it a shot. Before you know it, Kentucky
Fried Chicken will have fat-free fried chicken. Big Macs will contain 0 grams
of fat. And the amount of fat in a Pizza Hut cheese pizza? You guessed it&mdash;none!</p>

<p>In order to show how far out of hand peoples&rsquo;
obsession with fat-free foods has become, this description purposefully
exaggerates a world where the most unlikely things are fat-free.</p>

<p><u></strong>Irony</u> uses language that
makes a suggestion that directly contrasts with the literal word or idea. It
can offer humor to writing, or a bitter tone when it is used in sarcasm.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Scientists have worked hard to develop ways
to decrease infant mortality rates and increase longevity. As a result, more
people are living longer and scientists will soon have to develop some methods
with which to control overpopulation.</p>

<p>This sentence uses irony by predicting that,
because scientists have now discovered ways to increase a person&rsquo;s
life span, they will soon have to deal with another problem&mdash;overpopulation.
This is because, with everyone living longer, there will soon be too many
people for the earth to support.</p>

<p><u>Allusion</u> makes indirect
reference to known cultural works, people or events. The familiarity allusions
bring to writing helps the writer make connections with the reader.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>I have so much to do today, I feel like David
must have felt as he approached Goliath.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with the Bible story
of David and Goliath. David is a small shepherd who slays the giant, Goliath,
with a slingshot and one stone after the army&rsquo;s best soldiers fail.
Even through his feat, however, David must have felt a bit intimidated when
facing Goliath, a feeling this writer intimates when thinking about everything
that needs to be done.</p>

<p><strong>Figures of speech to avoid</strong></p>

<p><em>Clich&eacute;s</em> are overused phrases
that prevent your writing from being fresh and original, so don&rsquo;t use
clich&eacute;s like "Cute as a button"
or "Busy as a bee."</p>

<p><em>Mixed metaphors</em> are
comparisons that are not consistent; they only cause confusion. For example, "The
infant was like a baby bird, opening his cavernous well for food."
Here the simile that an infant is like a baby bird holds true, but the
following words that equate the baby&rsquo;s mouth to a cavernous well are
not consistent.</p>
