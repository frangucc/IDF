How many different ways can 3 cubes be
painted if each cube is painted one color and only the 3 colors red, blue, and
green are available? (Order is not considered, for example, green, green, blue
is considered the same as green, blue, green.)</p>

	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> Clearly, there are more than 3 color
combinations possible. This eliminates (A) and (B). We can also eliminate (C)
and (E) because they are both multiples of 3, and that would be too ordinary,
too easy, to be the answer. <br>Hence, by process of elimination, <strong>the
answer is D</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also solve this problem directly. The
following list displays all <span class="equation">27&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3</span> color combina tions possible (without
restriction):</p>

  then there are 10 district color 
  combinations in this list. 
  You should count them.</p>
