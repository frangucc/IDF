	<h1>Level of Difficulty</h1>

<p>GRE math is very similar to SAT math, though surprisingly
slightly easier. The mathematical skills tested are very basic: only first year
high school algebra and geometry (no proofs). However, this does not mean that
the math section is easy. The medium of basic mathematics is chosen so that
everyone taking the test will be on a fairly even playing field. This way
students who majored in math, engineering, or science don&rsquo;t have an
undue advantage over students who majored in humanities. Although the questions
require only basic mathematics and all have simplesolutions, it can require considerable
 ingenuity to find the simple solution. Ifyou have taken a course 
in calculus or another advanced math topic, don&rsquo;tassume that you will
find the math section easy. Other than increasing yourmathematical maturity, 
little you learned in calculus will help on the GRE.</p>

<p>Quantitative comparisons are the most common math questions.
This is good news since they are mostly intuitive and require little math. Further,
they are the easiest math problems on which to improve since certain techniques&mdash;such
as substitution&mdash;are very effective.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, every GRE math problem has a simple
solution, but finding that simple solution may not be easy. The intent of the
math section is to test how skilled you are at finding the simple solutions. The
premise is that if you spend a lot of time working out long solutions you will
not finish as much of the test as students who spot the short, simple
solutions. So if you find yourself performing long calculations or applying
advanced mathematics&mdash;stop. You&rsquo;re heading in the wrong
direction.</p>

<p>To insure that you perform at your expected level on the
actual GRE, you need to develop a level of mathematical skill that is greater
than what is tested on the GRE. Hence, about 10% of the math problems in this
book are harder than actual GRE math problems.</p>
