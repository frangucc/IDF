is somewhat tempting: it s often said that we are ENSLAVED by BUREAUCRACY, but
that is meant in a figurative, not a literal, sense. Eliminate (A). Choice (B) does
not have a reasonably necessary relationship: a MONARCH may or may not ABNEGATE
(renounce) his or her crown. Eliminate (B). Choice (C) is the eye-catcher:
GENTRY reminds one of ARISTOCRACY. However, there is no relationship between
GENTRY and TALENT. Eliminate (C). <strong>Choice (D) is the
answer</strong>. A paraphrase for ARISTOCRAT : LAND might be  an

DIGNITARY has privilege in society due to RANK.</span></p>
