	<h1>Structure</h1></p>

<p>Now that you know when to use a semicolon instead of a
comma, how do you get started writing your essay? Learning the rules that govern
written English is one thing; putting your knowledge to use is another. We will
discuss some specific tips in each of the essay sections later, but for now, we
will look at some general techniques to make your essay the best it can be. We
begin by looking at the proper structure for your introduction and for your
conclusion. </p>

<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>

<p>Your introduction should serve two
structural purposes: It should restate your topic so that the reader need not
review the given question, and it should offer a clear thesis so the reader
knows what your purpose is. Simply defined, a thesis states the main idea of
your essay. Because the strategy you need to employ for developing your thesis
differs for each type of essay, however, we will discuss it in further detail
later on in this section.</p>

<p>Your introduction should, in effect, restate
the given topic. In other words, your reader should be able to ascertain the
issue or argument without reading the given topic. Suppose the GRE gives you
this argument:</p>

<p><em>The following letter was sent by a
group of homeowners from the Rivermill Subdivision to all homeowners in that
subdivision.</em></p>

<p>"Providence Golf
Community down the street has a homeowner&rsquo;s association. Part of the
role of this association is to develop bylaws, which dictate the outside
appearance of all homes in the community. For example, according to the rules
set forth in the covenant, homeowners may only build privacy fences around
their yard; no chain link is permitted. Property values in this community are
double property values in our subdivision. In order to raise our property
values, we need to improve the look of our neighborhood. Therefore, we should
start an association and develop a covenant." </p>

<p>Your initial reaction to this prompt may be
to begin your essay with a direct response such as <em>This letter
presents a faulty argument. </em>However, this introductory sentence does
not provide adequate information because it does not specify <em>which</em>
letter and therefore it would leave the reader confused. Following is the
beginning of an introduction that does give adequate information to the reader:</p>

<p>Does the adoption of covenants in housing
communities result in rising property values? In a letter to the residents of
Rivermill Subdivision, a small group of homeowners stated that property values
in nearby Providence were double the property values in Rivermill because of such
a covenant.</p>

<p>Not only should you restate the topic, but
you should also do so in a way that will spark interest. It may seem like a
tall order to restate your topic, create a thesis, AND make it captivating, but
if you don&rsquo;t grab your reader&rsquo;s attention in the
introduction, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how interesting the body of your
essay is because he won&rsquo;t feel compelled to read on. Think of your
introduction as the worm on a fishhook, just dangling there enticing the fish
to bite. There are several techniques you can employ to get your reader to "bite"
and, thus, read on.</p>

<p>&bull; Begin your introduction
with a question. Naturally, when a question is posed to your reader, he or she
will want to keep reading to find out the answer.</p>

<p>&bull; Begin your introduction with a quote.
Because you will not have time to research your topic for the GRE test, this
may not be as feasible as, say, on a term paper for a graduate class; however,
if you can remember a specific quote pertinent to your topic, use it.</p>

<p>&bull; Begin with an anecdote. An anecdote is
entertaining and will thus draw in the reader.</p>

<p>&bull; Begin with an illustration or a
hypothetical example based on the topic you are going to discuss.</p>

<p>&bull; Begin with a true-to-life example.</p>

<p>&bull; Begin with vivid description of something
pertaining to your topic.</p>

<p>It is particularly important that, in the
context of the GRE, you make a concerted effort to create a captivating introduction.
Keep in mind that the scorers of your essays are the scorers of everyone else&rsquo;s
essays. They read hundreds of responses to the same issues and arguments. You
must make your essay stand out. What better way to make it stand out than to
make it exceptional from the beginning?</p>

<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>

<p>The conclusion of your essay is
just as important as the introduction because it wraps up your thoughts and
evidence and should leave your reader satisfied that a convincing discussion has
just taken place. Your conclusion should include a restatement of your thesis
and then end with a more general statement, perhaps a warning or a call for
action. Tip: If time is running out and you get stuck trying to formulate a
conclusion, try beginning with "In conclusion"
or "In summary." Then
continue by restating your thesis.</p>
