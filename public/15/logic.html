	<h1>Logic</h1>
	<p>Because the <em>Analyze an Argument</em> section
of the test requires you to critique an argument and discuss the logical
soundness of it, we will study the logic of arguments before we begin writing
our essays.</p>

<p><strong><u>Conclusions</u></strong></p>

<p>Most argument questions hinge,
either directly or indirectly, on determining the conclusion of the argument.
The conclusion is the main idea of the argument. It is what the writer tries to
persuade the reader to believe. Most often the conclusion comes at the end of
the argument. The writer organizes the facts and his opinions so that they
build up to the conclusion. Sometimes, however, the conclusion will come at the
beginning of an argument; rarely does it come in the middle; and occasionally,
for rhetorical effect, the conclusion is not even stated.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The police are the armed guardians of the
social order. The blacks are the chief domestic victims of the American social
order. <u>A conflict of interest exists, therefore, between the blacks
and the police.</u>&mdash;Eldridge Cleaver, <em>Soul on
Ice</em></p>

<p>Here the first two sentences anticipate or
set up the conclusion. By changing the grammar slightly, the conclusion can be
placed at the beginning of the argument and still sound natural:</p>

<p><u>A conflict of interest exists
between the blacks and the police </u>because the police are the armed
guardians of the social order and the blacks are the chief domestic victims of
the American social order. </p>

<p>The conclusion can also be forced into the
middle:</p>

<p>The police are the armed guardians of the
social order. <u>So a conflict of interest exists between the blacks and
the police</u> because the blacks are the chief domestic victims of the
American social order.</p>

<p>It is generally awkward, as in the previous
paragraph, to place the conclusion in the middle of the argument because then
it cannot be fully anticipated by what comes before nor fully explained by what
comes after. On the rare occasion when a conclusion comes in the middle of an
argument, most often either the material that comes after it or the material
that comes before it is not essential.</p>

<p><u>In summary:</u> <br>
  To find the conclusion, check
the last sentence of the argument. If that is not the conclusion, check the
first sentence. Rarely does the conclusion come in the middle of an argument.</p>

<p>Writers use certain words to indicate that
the conclusion is about to be stated. Following is a list of the most common
conclusion indicators:</p>

<p>These conclusion flags are very helpful, but you must use
them cautiously because many of these words have other functions.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  All devout Muslims abstain from alcohol.
Steve is a devout Muslim. <u>Thus</u>, he abstains from alcohol.</p>

<p>In this example, <em>thus</em>
anticipates the conclusion that necessarily follows from the first two
sentences. Notice the different function of <em>thus</em> in the
following argument.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The problem is simple when the solution is <u>thus</u>
stated.</p>

<p>In this example, <em>thus</em>
means "in that manner."</p>

<p>Most often the conclusion of an argument is
put in the form of a statement (as with every example we have considered so
far). Sometimes, however, the conclusion is given as a command or obligation.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>All things considered, you ought to vote.</p>

<p>Here, the author implies that you are obliged
to vote.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>Son, unless you go to college, you will not
make a success of yourself. No Carnegie has ever been a failure. So you will go
to college.</p>

<p>Here the conclusion is given as an imperative
command.</p>

<p>The conclusion can even be put in the form of
a question. This rhetorical technique is quite effective in convincing people that
a certain position is correct. We are more likely to believe something if we
feel that we concluded it on our own, or at least if we feel that we were not
told to believe it. A conclusion put in question form can have this result.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The Nanuuts believe that they should not take
from Nature anything She cannot replenish during their lifetime. This assures
that future generations can enjoy the same riches of Nature that they have. At
the current rate of destruction, the rain forests will disappear during our
lifetime. Do we have an obligation to future generations to prevent this
result?</p>

<p>Here the author trusts that the power of her
argument will persuade the reader to answer the question affirmatively.</p>

<p>Taking this rhetorical technique one step
further, the writer may build up to the conclusion but leave it unstated. This
allows the reader to make up his own mind. If the build-up is done skillfully,
the reader will be more likely to agree with the author, without feeling
manipulated.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  He who is without sin should cast the first
stone. There is no one here who does not have a skeleton in his closet.</p>

<p>The unstated but obvious conclusion here is
that none of the people has the right to cast the first stone.</p>

<p>When determining the conclusion&rsquo;s
scope be careful not to read any more or less into it than the author states.
Certain words limit the scope of a statement. These words are called quantifiers&mdash;pay
close attention to them. Following is a list of the most important quantifiers:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Whether the world is Euclidean or
non-Euclidean is still an open question. However, if a star&rsquo;s
position is predicted based on non-Euclidean geometry, then when a telescope is
pointed to where the star should be it will be there. Whereas, if the star&rsquo;s
position is predicted based on Euclidean geometry, then when a telescope is
pointed to where the star should be it won&rsquo;t be there. This strongly
indicates that the world is probably non-Euclidean.</p>

<p>Although the opening to the passage states
that we don&rsquo;t know whether the world is non-Euclidean, the author
goes on to give evidence that it is non-Euclidean. The author doesn&rsquo;t
say that the world is non-Euclidean, just that evidence strongly indicates that
it is. In the last sentence, the word <em>probably</em> properly
limits the scope of the main idea that the world is most likely non-Euclidean
but can&rsquo;t be stated so definitively.</p>
