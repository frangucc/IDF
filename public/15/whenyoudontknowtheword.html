	<h1>WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW THE WORD</h1></p>

<p>As we mentioned, you can&rsquo;t possibly memorize the
whole dictionary, and, while you can learn the words in a list of words that
occur most frequently on the GRE, there will inevitably still be some that you
do not know. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged. Again, there are some very
effective techniques that can be applied when a word does not look familiar to
you.</p>

<p><strong>Put The Word In Context</strong></p>

<p>In our daily speech, we combine words into phrases and
sentences; rarely do we use a word by itself. This can cause words that we have
little trouble understanding in sentences to suddenly appear unfamiliar when we
view them in isolation. For example, take the word</p>

<p><strong>Whet</strong></p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t recognize it in isolation. Yet
most people understand it in the following phrase:</p>

<p><strong>To whet your appetite</strong></p>

<p><em>Whet</em> means to "stimulate."</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t recognize the meaning of a word,
think of a phrase in which you have heard it used.</p>

<p>For another example, take the word</p>

<p><strong>Hallow</strong></p>

<p>In isolation, it may seem unfamiliar to you. However, you
probably understand its use in the phrase</p>

<p><strong>The hallowed halls of academia</strong></p>

<p><em>Hallow</em> means "to
make sacred, to honor."</p>

<p><strong>Change The Word Into A More Common Form</strong></p>

<p>Most words are built from other words. Although you may not
know a given word, you may spot the root word from which it is derived and
thereby deduce the meaning of the original word. </p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 PERTURBATION: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>impotence
</p></li><li><p>obstruction </p></li><li><p>prediction
</p></li><li><p>equanimity </p></li><li><p>chivalry</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>You
may not know how to pronounce PERTURBATION let alone know what it means. However,
changing its ending yields the more common form of the word "perturbed,"
which means "upset, agitated."
The opposite of upset is calm, which is exactly what EQUANIMITY means. <strong>The
answer is (D)</strong>.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 TEMPESTUOUS: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>prodigal
</p></li><li><p>reticent </p></li><li><p>serene 
</p></li><li><p>phenomenal </p></li><li><p>accountable</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>TEMPESTUOUS
is a hard word. However, if we drop the ending "stuous"
and add the letter "r"
we get the common word "temper."
The opposite of having a temper is being calm or SERENE. <strong>The
answer is (C)</strong>.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 VISCID: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>subtle
</p></li><li><p>faint </p></li><li><p>slick
</p></li><li><p>vicious </p></li><li><p>difficult</p></li></ol>

<p><strong>Test Words For Positive And Negative
Connotations</strong></p>

<p>Testing words for positive and negative connotations is
probably the most effective technique for antonyms. Surprisingly, you can often
solve an antonym problem knowing only that the word has a negative connotation.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 REPUDIATE: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>denounce
</p></li><li><p>deceive </p></li><li><p>embrace
</p></li><li><p>fib </p></li><li><p>generalize</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>You
may not know what REPUDIATE means, but you probably sense that it has a
negative connotation. Since we are looking for a word whose meaning is opposite
of REPUDIATE, we eliminate any answer-choices that are also negative. Now, "denounce,"
"deceive," and "fib"
are all, to varying degrees, negative. So eliminate them.
"Generalize" has a
neutral connotation: it can be positive, negative, or neither. So eliminate it
as well. Hence, by process of elimination, <strong>the answer is
(C)</strong>, EMBRACE.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong> <br>
NOXIOUS: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>diffuse
</p></li><li><p>latent </p></li><li><p>beneficial
</p></li><li><p>unique </p></li><li><p>
unjust</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>NOXIOUS
has a negative connotation (strongly so). Therefore, we are looking for a word
with a positive connotation. Now "diffuse"
means "spread out, widely scattered."
Hence, it is neutral in meaning, neither positive nor negative. Thus, we
eliminate it. "Latent"
and "unique" are also
neutral in meaning&mdash;eliminate. "Unjust"
has a negative connotation&mdash;eliminate. The only word remaining,
BENEFICIAL, has a strongly positive connotation and is the answer.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Any GRE Word That Starts With
"De,"
"Dis," or
"Anti" Will Almost
Certainly Be Negative.</strong></p>

<p>Examples: Degradation, Discrepancy, Discriminating, Debase,
Antipathy</p>

<p><strong></p>

<p>Any GRE Word That Includes The Notion of Going up Will
Almost Certainly Be Positive, and any GRE Word That Includes The Notion of
Going Down Will Almost Certainly Be Negative.</strong></p>

<p>Examples (positive): Elevate, Ascendancy, Lofty</p>

<p>Examples (negative): Decline, Subjugate, Suborn (to
encourage false witness)</p>



<p><strong>Watch Out For Eye-Catchers</strong></p>

<p>Some answer-choices will catch your eye by reminding you of
some part of the original word or some common meaning of the word. Be wary of
these choices&mdash;they are eye-catchers.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 SUFFRAGE: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>absence
of charity </p></li><li><p>absence of franchise </p></li><li><p>absence
of pain</p></li><li><p>absence of success </p></li><li><p>absence
of malice</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>SUFFRAGE
is a hard word. It appears to come from the word "suffer."
The opposite of suffering would be an absence of pain. However, that connection
would be too easy, too obvious for this hard problem.
"Absence of pain" is a
trap. In fact, SUFFRAGE means "the right to vote."
And FRANCHISE is a synonym for "vote."
Hence, <strong>the answer is (B)</strong>, ABSENCE OF FRANCHISE.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Be Alert To Secondary (Often Rare) Meanings Of Words</strong></p>

<p>The GRE writers often use common words but with their
uncommon meanings. An example will illustrate.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong> <br>
CHAMPION: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>relinquish
</p></li><li><p>contest </p></li><li><p>oppress
</p></li><li><p>modify </p></li><li><p>withhold</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
common meaning of CHAMPION is "winner."
Its opposite would be "loser."
But no answer-choice given above is synonymous with "loser."
CHAMPION also means to support or fight for someone else. (Think of the phrase "to
champion a cause.") Hence, <strong>the answer
is (C)</strong>, OPPRESS.</p>

<p>The parts of speech in an antonym problem are consistent
throughout the problem. Hence, if the given word is a verb, then every
answer-choice will be a verb as well. This fact often helps you determine
whether a word is being used in a secondary sense because words often have
different meanings depending on their use as nouns, verbs, or adjectives.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 AIR: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>release
</p></li><li><p>differ </p></li><li><p>expose
</p></li><li><p>betray </p></li><li><p>enshroud</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>AIR
is commonly used as a noun&mdash;indicating that which we breathe. But
every answer-choice is a verb. Hence, AIR in this case must also be a verb. A
secondary meaning for AIR is to discuss publicly. The opposite is to ENSHROUD,
to hide, to conceal. Hence, <strong>the answer is (E)</strong>.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Use Your Past Knowledge / Education</strong></p>

<p>Since you are studying for the GRE, you have probably
completed, or almost completed, your undergraduate studies. Therefore, you have
a wealth of knowledge from which to draw when it comes to examining the words
that will appear on the test. In your undergraduate classes, you studied
history and probably one or more foreign languages. You may have even taken a
Latin class. Because the English language has "borrowed"
many words from other languages, especially Latin and French, these classes
give you valuable clues to the meanings of many of the words you may come
across.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong> <br>
NARCISSISTIC: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>egocentric
</p></li><li><p>complacent </p></li><li><p>pretentious
</p></li><li><p>unostentatious </p></li><li><p>unassertive</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>You
may remember Narcissus from one of your literature and Greek mythology classes.
One version of the story of Narcissus relates a man who falls in love with his
own reflection in a pool. Because of his requited love, he dies. As a man in
love with his own reflection, he portrays self-love to the ultimate degree. A
man like this is pretentious. <em>Unostentatious</em> is the
opposite of <em>pretentious</em>. Hence, <strong>the answer
is (D)</strong>, UNOSTENTATIOUS.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 VERDANT: </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>na ve
</p></li><li><p>seasoned </p></li><li><p>ignorant
</p></li><li><p>qamateur </p></li><li><p>innocent</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Recall
from your Spanish class that <em>verde</em> means "green"
and from your French class that <em>vert</em> means "green"
as well. These words may remind you of the word <em>verdant</em>,
which also means "green"
and can refer to being "green"
in experience or judgment. Therefore, in this example, (B), SEASONED, is the
answer because it means "experienced."<strong></strong></p>
