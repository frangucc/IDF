	<h1>DIFFERENT CONNOTATIONS</h1></p>

<p>In this type of analogy, the paired words have similar
meanings but different connotations. These analogies can also be viewed as
rough synonyms; but often the connotations are so different that the paired
words at first don&rsquo;t appear to be synonyms. A few examples will
illustrate.</p>



<p><strong>Example: <br>
MOCK : IMITATE
::</strong></div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>interrogate
: question</p></li><li><p>caution : suggest</p></li><li><p>machinate
: confuse</p></li><li><p>migrate : compile</p></li><li><p>deceive
: swindle</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Both
MOCK and IMITATE mean to copy. But MOCK has a strong negative connotation. More
precisely, MOCK means to IMITATE in a taunting or ridiculing manner. Similarly,
INTERROGATE and QUESTION mean the same thing, but INTERROGATE has a negative
connotation and QUESTION has a neutral connotation. <strong>The answer is
(A)</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Example: <br>
CONSPIRE : COLLABORATE
::</strong></div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>invade
: defend</p></li><li><p>bias : inspire</p></li><li><p>promote
: impede</p></li><li><p>parry : assist</p></li><li><p>preempt
: respect</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Both
CONSPIRE and COLLABORATE mean to work together, but CONSPIRE is negative and
COLLABORATE is usually positive. For example, the revolutionaries CONSPIRED to
overturn the government, but the scientists COLLABORATED on the project. Similarly,
both BIAS and INSPIRE mean to influence, but BIAS is usually negative and
INSPIRE is positive. <strong>The answer is (B)</strong>.</p>
