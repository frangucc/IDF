	<h1>Faulty Verb Tense</h1></p>

<p>A verb has four principal parts:</p>

<p><strong>1. Present Tense</strong></p>

<p>a. Used to express present tense.</p>

<p><em>He studies
hard.</em></p>

<p>b. Used to express general truths.</p>

cautious about taking on more debt.</em></p>

<p>c. Used with <em>will</em> or <em>shall</em>
to express future time.</p>

<p><em>He will take the GRE next
year.</em></p>

<p><strong>2. Past Tense</strong></p>

<p>a. Used to express past tense.</p>

<p><em>He took the GRE last
year</em>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Past Participle</strong></p>

<p>a. Used to form the <em>present perfect
tense</em>, which indicates that an action was started in the past and
its effects are continuing in the present. It is formed using <em>have</em>
or <em>has</em> and the past participle of the verb.</p>

<p><em>He has prepared thoroughly for the
GRE.</em></p>

<p>b. Used to form the <em>past perfect
tense</em>, which indicates that an action was completed before another
past action. It is formed using <em>had</em> and the past
participle of the verb.</p>

<p><em>He had prepared thoroughly before
taking the GRE.</em></p>

<p>c. Used to form the <em>future perfect
tense</em>, which indicates that an action will be completed before
another future action. It is formed using <em>will have</em> or <em>shall
have</em> and the past participle of the verb.</p>

<p><em>He will have prepared thoroughly
before taking the GRE.</em></p>

<p><strong>4. Present Participle (<em>-ing</em> form of the
verb)</strong></p>

<p>a. Used to form the <em>present
progressive tense</em>, which indicates that an action is ongoing. It is
formed using <em>is</em>, <em>am</em>, or <em>are</em>
and the present participle of the verb.</p>

<p><em>He is preparing thoroughly for the
GRE.</em></p>

<p>b. Used to form the <em>past
progressive tense</em>, which indicates that an action was in progress in
the past. It is formed using <em>was</em> or <em>were</em>
and the present participle of the verb.</p>

<p><em>He was preparing for the
GRE.</em></p>

<p>c. Used to form the <em>future
progressive tense</em>, which indicates that an action will be in
progress in the future. It is formed using <em>will be</em> or <em>shall
be</em> and the present participle of the verb.</p>

<p><em>He will be preparing thoroughly for
the GRE.</em></p>

<p>PASSIVE VOICE</p>

<p>The passive voice removes the subject from
the sentence. It is formed with the verb <em>to be</em> and the
past participle of the main verb.</p>

<p>Passive:</p>

<p><em>The bill was resubmitted by the
Senator.</em></p>

<p>Active:</p>

<p><em>The Senator has resubmitted the
bill.</em></p>

<p>Unless you want to de-emphasize the doer of
an action, you should favor the active voice.</p>
