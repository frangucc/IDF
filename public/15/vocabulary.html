	<h1>Vocabulary</h1>
<p>The verbal section is essentially a vocabulary test.  With the exception of the reading comprehension and a few of the hardest analogies, if you know the word, you will probably be able to answer the question correctly.  Thus, it is crucial that you improve your vocabulary.  Even if you have a strong vocabulary, you will still encounter unfamiliar words on the GRE.</p>

<p>Many students write off questions which contain words they don’t recognize.  This is a mistake.  The rest of the verbal portion of the book will introduce numerous techniques that will decode unfamiliar words and prod your memory of words you only half-remember.  With these techniques you will often be able to squeeze out enough meaning from an unfamiliar word to answer a question correctly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, don’t rely on just these techniques—you must study word lists.  Obviously, you cannot attempt to memorize the dictionary, and you don’t need to.  The GRE tests a surprisingly limited number of words.  At the end of the verbal portion of this book, you will find a list of 4000 essential words.  Granted, memorizing a list of words is rather dry, but it is probably the most effective way of improving your performance on the verbal section.</p>
