<p><strong>Techniques To Learn New Words</strong></p>

<p>&rarr;Put the definition in your own words</p>

<p>&rarr;Write down the words</p>

<p>&rarr;Use flashcards</p>

<p>&rarr;Create a word picture</p>

<p>&rarr;Set goals</p>

<p><strong>When You Don&rsquo;t Know The Word</strong></p>

<p>&rarr;Put the word in context</p>

<p>&rarr;Change the word into a more common form</p>

<p>&rarr;Test words for positive and negative
connotation</p>

<p>&rarr;Watch out for eye-catchers</p>

<p>&rarr;Be alert to secondary (often rare) meanings
of words</p>

<p>&rarr;Use your past education/knowledge</p>

<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>

<p>&rarr;If the word starts with "De,"
"Dis," or "Anti,"
the word most likely has a negative connotation.</p>

<p>&rarr;If the word contains the notion of going up,
it will most likely have a positive connotation.</p>

<p>&rarr;If the word contains the notion of going
down, it will most likely have a negative connotation.</p>

<p>&rarr;Hard problems have hard answers. Hence be
wary of common words on hard problems. But don&rsquo;t eliminate them for
that reason alone: they may still be the answer. So if the given word is
totally unfamiliar and none of the previous techniques have helped, then choose
the hardest or most unusual word.</p>

<p>&rarr;You can eliminate answer-choices
intelligently: eliminate any that are synonyms (have the same meaning) as the
given word; eliminate any answer-choices that have the same antonym.</p>

<p>&rarr;Never spend more than 30 seconds on an
antonym problem.</p>
