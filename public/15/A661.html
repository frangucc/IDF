	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q.&nbsp;</span>After reading the following passage, choose the best answer to the question.  Answer on the basis of what is <u>stated</u> or <u>implied</u> in that passage.
</div>
<div class="passage">Imagine that we stand on any ordinary seaside
pier, and watch the waves rolling in and striking against the iron columns of
the pier. Large waves pay very little attention to the columns&mdash;they
divide right and left and re-unite after passing each column, much as a
regiment of soldiers would if a tree stood in their way; it is almost as though
the columns had not been there. But the short waves and ripples find the
columns of the pier a much more formidable obstacle. When the short waves
impinge on the columns, they are reflected back and spread as new ripples in
all directions. To use the technical term, they are "scattered."
<span class="highlight">The obstacle provided by the iron columns hardly affects the long waves at all,
but scatters the short ripples.</span></p>

<p>We have been watching a working model of the way in which
sunlight struggles through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Between us on
earth and outer space the atmosphere interposes innumerable obstacles in the
form of molecules of air, tiny droplets of water, and small particles of dust. They
are represented by the columns of the pier.</p>

<p>The waves of the sea represent the sunlight. We know that
sunlight is a blend of lights of many colors&mdash;as we can prove for
ourselves by passing it through a prism, or even through a jug of water, or as
Nature demonstrates to us when she passes it through the raindrops of a summer
shower and produces a rainbow. We also know that light consists of waves, and
that the different colors of light are produced by waves of different lengths,
red light by long waves and blue light by short waves. The mixture of waves
which constitutes sunlight has to struggle through the obstacles it meets in
the atmosphere, just as the mixture of waves at the seaside has to struggle
past the columns of the pier. And these obstacles treat the light waves much as
the columns of the pier treat the sea-waves. The long waves which constitute
red light are hardly affected, but the short waves which constitute blue light
are scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>Thus, the different constituents of sunlight are treated in
different ways as they struggle through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. A
wave of blue light may be scattered by a dust particle, and turned out of its
course. After a time a second dust particle again turns it out of its course,
and so on, until finally it enters our eyes by a path as zigzag as that of a
flash of lightning. Consequently, the blue waves of the sunlight enter our eyes
from all directions. And that is why the sky looks blue.</p>
From the information presented in the
passage, what can we conclude about the color of the sky on a day with a large
quantity of dust in the air?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>The
sky would be even bluer</p></li><li><p>The sky would be
redder</p></li><li><p>The sky would not change colors</p></li><li><p>We
do not have enough information to determine a change in color</p></li><li><p>The
sky would assume a violet hue</p></li></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>(A):
No. Although dust is mentioned as one of the three important obstacles (lines
highlighted in blue), we simply do not have enough information to conclude how dust
density would change sky color. </p>

<p>(B): No. While this idea may fit with the common lore that a
lot of dust in the air creates great, red sunsets, the passage itself gives no
basis to any conclusion regarding color change. </p>

<p>(C): No. Same reason as in (A) and (B). </p>
<p><strong>(D):
Yes</strong>. There is not enough information in the passage to determine
a relationship between color change and dust density. The dust may give off a
certain color of its own&mdash;we can&rsquo;t say for certain.</p>
