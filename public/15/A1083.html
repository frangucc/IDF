</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect because <em>his</em> appears to refer to <em>the
President</em>, but the subject of the subordinate clause is <em>the
President&rsquo;s Administration</em>, not <em>the
President</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (B) changes the structure of the sentence, but
retains the same flawed reference.</p>

<p>In choice (C), <em>it</em> can refer to either <em>the
President&rsquo;s Administration</em> or <em>the budget
reduction package</em>. Thus, the reference is ambiguous.</p>

<p>Choice (D) adds another pronoun, <em>its</em>,
but still retains the same flawed reference.</p>

<p>Choice (E) corrects the flawed reference by removing all
pronouns. <strong>The answer is (E).</p>
