<div class="passage">
<p>In the United States the per capita costs of schooling have
risen almost as fast as the cost of medical treatment. But increased treatment
by both doctors and teachers has shown steadily declining results. Medical
expenses concentrated on those above forty-five have doubled several times over
a period of forty years with a resulting 3 percent increase in the life
expectancy of men. The increase in educational expenditures has produced even
stranger results; otherwise President Nixon could not have been moved this
spring to promise that every child shall soon have the "Right
to Read" before leaving school.</p>

<p>In the United States it would take eighty billion dollars
per year to provide what educators regard as equal treatment for all in grammar
and high school. This is well over twice the $36 billion now being spent. Independent
cost projections prepared at HEW and at the University of Florida indicate that
by 1974 the comparable figures will be $107 billion as against the $45 billion
now projected, and these figures wholly omit the enormous costs of what is
called "higher education,"
for which demand is growing even faster. The United States, which spent nearly
eighty billion dollars in 1969 for "defense,"
including its deployment in Vietnam, is obviously too poor to provide equal
schooling. The President&rsquo;s committee for the study of school finance
should ask not how to support or how to trim such increasing costs, but how
they can be avoided.</p>

<p>Equal obligatory schooling must be recognized as at least
economically unfeasible. In Latin America the amount of public money spent on
each graduate student is between 350 and 1,500 times the amount spent on the
median citizen (that is, the citizen who holds the middle ground between the
poorest and the richest). In the United States the discrepancy is smaller, but
the discrimination is keener. The richest parents, some 10 percent, can afford
private education for their children and help them to benefit from foundation
grants. But in addition they obtain ten times the per capita amount of public
funds if this is compared with the per capita expenditure made on the children
of the 10 percent who are poorest. The principal reasons for this are that rich
children stay longer in school, that a year in a university is
disproportionately more expensive than a year in high school, and that most
private universities depend&mdash;at least indirectly&mdash;on
tax-derived finances.</p>

<p>Obligatory schooling inevitably polarizes a society; it also
grades the nations of the world according to an international caste system. Countries
are rated like castes whose educational dignity is determined by the average
years of schooling of its citizens, a rating which is closely related to per
capita gross national product, and much more painful.</p><p>Why does the author consider the results from
increased educational expenditures to be "even
stranger" than those from increased medical
expenditures?</div><div class="options"><ol

class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is an extension question. We are asked to interpret a statement by the author. The
needed reference is the closing sentence to paragraph one. Remember: extension
questions require you to go beyond the passage, so the answer won&rsquo;t
be explicitly stated in the reference&mdash;we will have to interpret it.</p>

<p>The implication of President Nixon&rsquo;s promise is
that despite increased educational funding many children cannot even read when
they graduate from school. Hence <strong>the answer is
(B).</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of choosing (C). Although
at first glance this is a tempting inference, it would be difficult to compare
the results of education and medical care directly (how would we do so?). Regardless,
the opening line to the passage states that educational costs have risen "almost
as fast" as medical costs, not faster.</p>

<p>(A) is incorrect because the passage never mentions the
aging of the population. The same is true for (D).</p>

<p>Many students who cannot solve this question choose (E)&mdash;don&rsquo;t.
It uses as bait language from the passage, <em>"inevitably
polarizes a society."</em> <br>Note: The phrase "Right
to Read" in (B) is not a same language trap; it is
merely part of a paraphrase of the passage. The correct answer to an extension
question will often both paraphrase and extend a passage statement but will not
quote it directly, as in (E).</p>
