	<h1>Experimental Section</h1>

<p>The GRE is a standardized test. Each time it is offered, the
test has, as close as possible, the same level of difficulty as every previous
test. Maintaining this consistency is very difficult&mdash;hence the
experimental section. The effectiveness of each question must be assessed
before it can be used on the GRE. A problem that one person finds easy another
person may find hard, and vice versa. The experimental section measures the
relative difficulty of potential questions; if responses to a question do not
perform to strict specifications, the question is rejected.</p>

<p>The experimental section can be a verbal section or a math
section. You won&rsquo;t know which section is experimental. You will know
which type of section it is, though, since there will be an extra one of that
type.</p>

<p>Because the "bugs"
have not been worked out of the experimental section&mdash;or, to put it
more directly, because you are being used as a guinea pig to work out the "bugs"&mdash;this
portion of the test is often more difficult and confusing than the other parts.</p>

<p>This brings up an ethical issue: How many students have run
into the experimental section early in the test and have been confused and
discouraged by it? Crestfallen by having done poorly on, say, the first&mdash;though
experimental&mdash;section, they lose confidence and perform below their
ability on the rest of the test. Some testing companies are becoming more
enlightened in this regard and are administering experimental sections as
separate practice tests. Unfortunately, ETS has yet to see the light.</p>

<p>Knowing that the experimental section can be
disproportionately difficult, if you do poorly on a particular section you can
take some solace in the hope that it may have been the experimental section. In
other words, do not allow one difficult section to discourage your performance
on the rest of the test.</p>
