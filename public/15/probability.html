	<h1>PROBABILITY</h1></strong></p>

<p>We know what probability means, but what is its formal
definition? Let&rsquo;s use our intuition to define it. If there is no
chance that an event will occur, then its probability of occurring should be 0.
On the other extreme, if an event is certain to occur, then its probability of
occurring should be 100%, or 1. Hence, our probability
should be a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. But what kind of number? Suppose
your favorite actor has a 1 in 3 chance of winning the Oscar for best actor. This
can be measured by forming the fraction 1/3. Hence, a probability
is a fraction where the top is the number of ways an event can occur and the
bottom is the total number of possible events:</p>

<p><strong>Example: <em><br>
Flipping a coin</em></strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of getting heads when
flipping a coin? </p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong>There is only one way to get heads in a coin toss. Hence,
the top of the probability fraction is 1. There are two possible results: heads
or tails. Forming the probability fraction gives 1/2.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br> 
  <em>Tossing a die</em></strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of getting a 3 when tossing
a die?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong>A die (a cube) has six faces, numbered 1 through 6. There is
only one way to get a 3. Hence, the top of the fraction is 1. There are 6
possible results: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Forming the probability fraction gives
1/6.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br> 
  <em>Drawing a card from a
deck</em></strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of getting a king when
drawing a card from a deck of cards?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong>A deck of cards has four kings, so there are 4 ways to get a
king. Hence, the top of the fraction is 4. There are 52 total cards in a deck. Forming
the probability fraction gives 4/52, which reduces to 1/13. Hence, there is 1
chance in 13 of getting a king.</p>

<p><strong>Example: <em><br>
  Drawing marbles from a
bowl</em></strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of drawing a blue marble
from a bowl containing 4 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 5 green marbles?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong>There are five ways of drawing a blue marble. Hence, the top
of the fraction is 5. There are <span class="equation">14 (= 4 + 5 + 5)</span>&nbsp;possible results. Forming the
probability fraction gives 5/14.</p>

<p><strong>Example: <em><br>
  Drawing marbles from a bowl
(second drawing)</em></strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of drawing a red marble
from the same bowl, given that the first marble drawn was blue and was not
placed back in the bowl?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong>There are four ways of drawing a red marble. Hence, the top
of the fraction is 4. Since the blue marble from the first drawing was not
replaced, there are only 4 blue marbles remaining. Hence, there are <span class="equation">13
(=&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;5)</span> possible results. Forming the
probability fraction gives 4/13.</p>

<p><strong>Consecutive Probabilities</strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of getting heads twice in a
row when flipping a coin twice? Previously we calculated the probability for
the first flip to be 1/2. Since the second flip is not affected by the first
(these are called mutually exclusive events), its
probability is also 1/2. Forming the product yields the probability of two
heads in a row: <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</td>

</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span></span>
 .
 </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of drawing a blue marble
and then a red marble from a bowl containing 4 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and
5 green marbles? (Assume that the marbles are not replaced after being
selected.) As calculated before, there is a 5/14 likelihood of selecting a blue
marble first and a 4/13 likelihood of selecting a red marble second. Forming
the product yields the probability of a red marble immediately followed by a
blue marble: <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;182&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;91&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span></span>
 .
 </p>

<p>These two examples can be generalized into the following
rule for calculating consecutive probabilities:</p>



<p>To calculate consecutive probabilities, multiply the
individual probabilities.</p>

<p>This rule applies to two, three, or any number of
consecutive probabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Either-Or Probabilities</strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of getting either heads or
tails when flipping a coin once? Since the only possible outcomes are heads or
tails, we expect the probability to be 100%, or 1: <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</span> . Note that the events heads
and tails are mutually exclusive. That is, if heads occurs, then tails cannot
(and vice versa).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the probability of drawing a red marble or
a green marble from a bowl containing 4 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 5
green marbles? There are 4 red marbles out of 14 total marbles. So the
probability of selecting a red marble is 4/14 = 2/7. Similarly, the probability
of selecting a green marble is 5/14. So the probability of selecting a red or
green marble is <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span></span> . Note again that the events
are mutually exclusive. For instance, if a red marble is selected, then neither
a blue marble nor a green marble is selected.</p>

<p>These two examples can be generalized into the following
rule for calculating either-or probabilities:</p>



<p>To calculate either-or probabilities,
add the individual probabilities (only if the events are mutually exclusive).</p>

<p>The probabilities in the two immediately preceding examples
can be calculated more naturally by adding up the events that occur and then
dividing by the total number of possible events. For the coin example, we get 2
events (heads or tails) divided by the total number of possible events, 2
(heads and tails): 2/2 = 1. For the marble example, we get <span class="equation">9 (= 4 + 5)</span> ways the
event can occur divided by <span class="equation">14 (= 4 + 5 + 5)</span> possible events: 9/14.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s more natural to calculate the either-or
probabilities above by adding up the events that occur and then dividing by the
total number of possible events, why did we introduce a second way of
calculating the probabilities? Because in some cases, you may have to add the
individual probabilities. For example, you may be given the individual
probabilities of two mutually exclusive events and be asked for the probability
that either could occur. You now know to merely add their individual
probabilities.</p>
