	<h1>Counting</h1>

<p>Counting may have been one of humankind&rsquo;s first
thought processes; nevertheless, counting can be deceptively hard. In part,
because we often forget some of the principles of counting, but also because
counting can be inherently difficult.</p>

<p>When counting elements that are in overlapping sets, the
total number will equal the number in one group plus the number in the other
group minus the number common to both groups. Venn diagrams are very helpful
with these problems.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 If in a certain school
20 students are taking math and 10 are taking history and 7 are taking both,
how many students are taking either math or history?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>20</p></li><li><p>22</p></li><li><p>23</p></li><li><p>25</p></li><li><p>29</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>
<img width=175 height=135 src="countingimage062.gif"> </p>

<p>By the principle stated above, we add 10 and 20 and then
subtract 7 from the result. Thus, there are <span class="equation">(10 + 20) &ndash; 7 = 23</span>
students. <strong>The answer is (C).</strong></p>

<p>The number of integers between two integers inclusive is one more than their difference.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong> <br>
How many integers
are there between 49 and 101, inclusive?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>50</p></li><li><p>51</p></li><li><p>52</p></li><li><p>53</p></li><li><p>54</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>By
the principle stated above, the number of integers between 49 and 101 inclusive
is <span class="equation">(101 &ndash; 49) + 1 = 53</span>.<strong> The answer is (D)</strong>. To see this more clearly,
choose smaller numbers, say, 9 and 11. The difference between 9 and 11 is 2. But
there are three numbers between them inclusive&mdash;9, 10, and 11&mdash;one
more than their difference.</p>

<p>Fundamental Principle of Counting: If
an event occurs <em>m</em> times, and each of the
<em>m</em> events is followed by a second event which occurs
<em>k</em> times, then the first event follows the second event <em>m</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<em>k</em> times.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the fundamental principle
of counting for an event that occurs 3 times with each occurrence being
followed by a second event that occurs 2 times for a total of <span class="equation">3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;6</span> &nbsp;events:</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 A drum contains 3 to
5 jars each of which contains 30 to 40 marbles. If 10 percent of the marbles
are flawed, what is the greatest possible number of flawed marbles in the drum?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>51</p></li><li><p>40</p></li><li><p>30</p></li><li><p>20</p></li><li><p>12</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>There
is at most 5 jars each of which contains at most 40 marbles; so by the
fundamental counting principle, there is at most <span class="equation">5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;40&nbsp;=&nbsp;200</span>&nbsp;marbles in the drum. Since
10 percent of the marbles are flawed, there is at most <span class="equation">20&nbsp;=&nbsp;10%&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200</span> flawed marbles. <strong>The answer
is (D).</strong></p>

<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS COUNTING PROBLEMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example : </strong><br>
In a legislative body of 200
people, the number of Democrats is 50 less than 4 times the number of
Republicans. If one fifth of the legislators are neither Republican nor
Democrat, how many of the legislators are Republicans?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>42</p></li><li><p>50</p></li><li><p>71</p></li><li><p>95</p></li><li><p>124</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>D</em> be the number of Democrats and let <em>R</em>
be the number of Republicans. "One fifth of the
legislators are neither Republican nor Democrat,"
so there are <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;=&nbsp;40</span>
 legislators who are neither
Republican nor Democrat. Hence, there are <span class="equation">200 &ndash; 40 = 160</span> Democrats
and Republicans, or <span class="equation"><em>D</em> + <em>R</em> = 160</span>. Translating
the clause "the number of Democrats is 50 less than
4 times the number of Republicans" into an equation
yields <span class="equation"><em>D</em> = 4<em>R</em> &ndash; 50</span>. Plugging
this into the equation <span class="equation"><em>D</em> + <em>R</em> = 160</span>
yields</p>

<p>4<em>R</em> &ndash; 50 + <em>R</em>
= 160</p>

<p>5<em>R</em> &ndash; 50 = 160</p>

<p>5<em>R</em> = 210</p>

<p><em>R</em> = 42</p>

<p><strong>The answer is (A).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 Speed bumps are
being placed at 20 foot intervals along a road 1015 feet long. If the first
speed bump is placed at one end of the road, how many speed bumps are needed?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>49</p></li><li><p>50</p></li><li><p>51</p></li><li><p>52</p></li><li><p>53</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
the road is 1015 feet long and the speed bumps are 20 feet apart, there are <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1015&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50.75</span>
 , or 50
full sections in the road. If we ignore the first speed bump and associate the
speed bump at the end of each section with that section, then there are 50
speed bumps (one for each of the fifty full sections). Counting the first speed
bump gives a total of 51 speed bumps. <strong>The answer is (C)</strong>.
