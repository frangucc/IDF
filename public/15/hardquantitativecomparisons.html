	<h1>Hard Quantitative Comparisons</h1>

<p>Most of the time, we have an intuitive feel for whether a
problem is hard or easy. But on tricky problems (problems that appear easy but
are actually hard) our intuition can fail us.</p>

<p>On the test, your first question will be of medium
difficulty. If you answer it correctly, the next question will be a little
harder. If you again answer it correctly, the next question will be harder
still, and so on. If your math skills are strong and you are not making any
mistakes, you should reach the medium-hard or hard problems by about the fifth
problem. Although this is not very precise, it can be quite helpful. Once you
have passed the fifth question, you should be alert to subtleties in any
seemingly simple problems.</p>

<p>There are special techniques and strategies that apply to
the hard problems only. Do not apply the methods of this
section to the easy or medium quantitative comparison problems.</p>

<p>On Hard Quantitative Comparison Problems, The Obvious Answer
(The Eye-Catcher) Will Almost Always Be Wrong. (If one
expression looks at first glance to be larger than another, then it will not
be.)</p>


<p>This is so because when people cannot solve a problem, they
most often pick the answer-choice that "looks
right." But if that were the answer, most people
would answer it correctly and therefore it would not be a "hard"
problem.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><em>x</em> &#8805; 1</p>



<p><strong>Column A</strong></p>

<p><span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>10</sup></span></p>


<p><strong>Column B</strong></p>

<p><span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>100</sup></span></p>

<p></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>One
would expect <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>100</sup></span> to
be larger than <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>10</sup></span>.
But this is a hard problem and therefore what we expect will not be the answer.
Now, clearly <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>100</sup></span> cannot
always be less than <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>10</sup></span>. And just as clearly <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>100</sup></span> cannot always be equal to <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>10</sup></span>. Hence, <strong>the answer
is (D)</strong>&mdash;not-enough-information. (A double case can also be obtained by
substituting <span class="equation"><em>x</em> = 1</span> and then <span class="equation"><em>x</em> = 2.)</span></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Column A</strong></p>

<p>The number of distinct prime factors of <em>x</em></p>

<p><strong>Column B</strong></p>

<p>The number of distinct prime factors of 4<em>x</em></p>


<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>We
expect the number of prime factors of 4<em>x</em> to be larger than
the number of prime factors of <em>x</em>. But that is the
eye-catcher. Now, the number of prime factors of 4<em>x</em> cannot
be less than the number of prime factors of <em>x</em> since 4<em>x</em>
contains all the factors of <em>x</em>. So the answer must be that
either they are equal or there is not enough information. In fact, there is not
enough information, as can be verified by plugging in the numbers <em>x</em>
= 2 and then <em>x</em> = 3.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Column A </strong></p>

<p>The area of a square with perimeter 12 </p>

<p><strong>Column B</strong></p>

<p>The area of a parallelogram with perimeter 16</p>

<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>We
expect the area of the parallelogram to be larger. After all, the parallelogram
could be a square with perimeter 16, which of course has a larger area than a
square with perimeter 12. But that would be too easy. Hence, there must be a
parallelogram whose area is equal to or less than the area of the square. (See
whether you can draw it. Hint: Look at the extreme cases.) Thus, we have a
double case, and <strong>the answer is (D)</strong>&mdash;not-enough-information.</p>

<p><strong>Note 1: </strong>When plugging in on quantitative comparison
problems, be sure to check <span class="equation">0, 1, 2, &ndash;2, and 1/2,</span> in that order.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> If there are only numbers in a quantitative
comparison problem, i.e., no variables, then (D), not-enough-information,
cannot be the answer.</p>


<p><strong>Note 3: </strong>When drawing geometric figures, don&rsquo;t
forget extreme cases.</p>




<p>Eliminate Answer-Choices That Are Too Easily Derived or Too
Ordinary.</p>


<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>


<p><span class="equation"><em>x</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</span></p>

<p><strong>Column A</strong></p>

<p><em>x</em> + <em>y</em> </p>

<p><strong>Column B</strong></p>

<p>4</p>

<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
numbers 3 and 1 are solutions to the equation <span class="equation"><em>x</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</span> because <span class="equation">3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</span>. So for this choice of <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em>, Column A equals Column B, since <span class="equation">3 + 1 = 4.</span> But that
is too easy: Everyone will notice 1 and 3 as solutions of the equation <span class="equation"><em>x</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</span>. Hence, there must
be another pair of numbers whose product is 3 and </p>

<p>whose sum is not 4. In fact, there are an infinite number of
pairs. For example, <span class="equation">9&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                    
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3
</span>
, but <span class="equation">9&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                    
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;4
</span>



. This is a double case and therefore
<strong>the answer is (D)</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><img width=191 height=106
src="image007.gif"></p>

<p><strong>Column A </strong></p>

<p>The greatest number of regions into which two straight lines
will divide the shaded region.</p>

<p><strong>Column B</strong></p>

<p>4</p>

<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Most
people will draw one or the other of the two drawings below:</p>

<p><img width=221 height=115
src="image008.gif"> <img width=208 height=129
src="image009.gif"></p>

<p>In each case, four separate shaded regions are formed. But
these drawings are too ordinary, too easy. There must be a way to draw the
lines to form more than four regions. Try to draw it before looking at the
answer below.</p>

  The lines must intersect in the
shaded region.</p>
