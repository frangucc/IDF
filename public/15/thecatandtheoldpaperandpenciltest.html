	<h1>The CAT & the Old Paper-&-Pencil Test</h1>

<p>The computer based GRE uses the same type of questions as
the old paper & pencil test. The only difference is the medium, that is the
way the questions are presented.</p>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to the CAT. Probably
the biggest advantages are that you can take the CAT just about any time and
you can take it in a small room with just a few other people&mdash;instead
of in a large auditorium with hundreds of other stressed people. One the other
hand, you cannot return to previously answered questions, it is easier to
misread a computer screen than it is to misread printed material, and it can be
distracting looking back and forth from the computer screen to your scratch
paper.</p>
