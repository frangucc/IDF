	<h1>Sequences</h1>
	<p>A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. The following is a
sequence of odd numbers:</p>

<p>1, 3, 5, 7, . . .</p>

<p>A term of a sequence is identified by its position in the
sequence. In the above sequence, 1 is the first term, 3 is the second term,
etc. The ellipsis symbol (. . .) indicates that the sequence continues forever.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
 In sequence S, the
3rd term is 4, the 2nd term is three times the 1st, and the 3rd term is four
times the 2nd. What is the 1st term in sequence S?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>0</p></li><li><p>1/3</p></li><li><p>1</p></li><li><p>3/2</p></li><li><p>4</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>We
know "the 3rd term of S is
4," and that "the
3rd term is four times the 2nd." This is
equivalent to saying the 2nd term is 1/4 the 3rd term: <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</span>. Further, we know "the
2nd term is three times the 1st." This
is equivalent to saying the 1st term is 1/3 the 2nd term: <span class="equation"><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span></span>. Hence, the first
term of the sequence is fully determined:
 </p>

<p><span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span> , 1, 4</p>

<p><strong>The answer is (B).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong> <br>
Except for the first
two numbers, every number in the sequence &ndash;1, 3, &ndash;3, . . .
is the product of the two immediately preceding numbers. How many numbers of
this sequence are odd?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>one</p></li><li><p>two</p></li><li><p>three</p></li><li><p>four</p></li><li><p>more
than four</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Since "every number in the sequence &ndash;1,
3, &ndash;3, . . . is the product of the two
immediately preceding numbers," the
forth term of the sequence is <span class="equation">&ndash;9 = 3(&ndash;3)</span>. The first 6 terms
of this sequence are</p>

<p><span class="equation">&ndash;1, 3, &ndash;3, &ndash;9, 27, &ndash;243,
. . .</span></p>

<p>At least six numbers in this sequence are odd: <span class="equation">&ndash;1,
3, &ndash;3, &ndash;9, 27, &ndash;243</span>. <strong>The answer is (E)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Arithmetic Progressions</strong></p>

<p>An arithmetic progression is a sequence in which the
difference between any two consecutive terms is the same. This is the same as
saying: each term exceeds the previous term by a fixed amount. For example, 0,
6, 12, 18, . . . is an arithmetic progression in which the common difference is
6. The sequence 8, 4, 0, &ndash;4, . . . is arithmetic with a common
difference of &ndash;4. </p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong> <br>
  The seventh number
in a sequence of numbers is 31 and each number after the first number in the
sequence is 4 less than the number immediately preceding it. What is the fourth
number in the sequence?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>15</p></li><li><p>19</p></li><li><p>35</p></li><li><p>43</p></li><li><p>51</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
each number "in the sequence is 4 less
than the number immediately preceding it,"
the sixth term is <span class="equation">31 + 4 = 35</span>; the fifth number in the sequence is
<span class="equation">35 + 4 = 39</span>; and the fourth number in the sequence is <span class="equation">39 + 4 = 43</span>.<strong> The answer
is (D).</strong> Following is the sequence written out:</p>

<p><span class="equation">55, 51, 47, 43, 39, 35, 31, 27, 23, 19, 15, 11 . . .</span></p>
