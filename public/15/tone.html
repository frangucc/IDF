  <h1>Tone</h1>
  <p>The words you choose will greatly
affect the tone of your essay. Likewise, the tone you wish to achieve will
depend on your audience. In this case, you know your audience will consist of
men and women who will be quickly reading your essay and then assigning a score
based on their impression and how well you handled the topic. Knowing this, you
will want to use a professional, formal tone, the kind you will probably use in
most of your graduate work. Using a formal tone means that you will want to
keep some distance between you, the writer, and your audience, the scorer. Be
courteous and polite but avoid being chummy or intimate in any way.
Furthermore, you should avoid all colloquialisms and slang.</p>
