</div>
<div class="passage"><p>Global strategies to control infectious
disease have historically included the erection of barriers to international
travel and immigration. Keeping people with infectious diseases outside
national borders has reemerged as an important public health policy in the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. Between 29 and 50 countries are
reported to have introduced border restrictions on HIV-positive foreigners,
usually those planning an extended stay in the country, such as students,
workers, or seamen. </p>

<p>Travel restrictions have been established primarily by
countries in the western Pacific and Mediterranean regions, where HIV
seroprevalence is relatively low. However, the country with the broadest policy
of testing and excluding foreigners is the United States. From December 1,
1987, when HIV infection was first classified in the United States as a
contagious disease, through September 30, 1989, more than 3 million people
<span class="highlight">seeking permanent residence in this country were tested for HIV antibodies. The
U.S. policy has been sharply criticized by national and international
organizations as being contrary to</span> public health goals and human-rights
principles. Many of these organizations are boycotting international meetings
in the United States that are vital for the study of prevention, education, and
treatment of HIV infection.</p>

<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act requires the Public
Health Service to list "dangerous contagious
diseases" for which aliens can be excluded from the
United States. By 1987 there were seven designated diseases&mdash;five of
them sexually transmitted (chancroid, gonorrhea, granuloma inguinale,
lymphog-ranuloma venereum, and infectious syphilis) and two non-venereal
(active tuberculosis and infectious leprosy). On June 8, 1987, in response to a
Congressional direction in the Helms Amendment, the Public Health Service added
HIV infection to the list of dangerous contagious diseases.</p>

<p>A just and efficacious travel and immigration policy would not
exclude people because of their serologic status unless they posed a danger to
the community through casual transmission. U.S. regulations should list only
active tuberculosis as a contagious infectious disease. We support well-funded
programs to protect the health of travelers infected with HIV through
appropriate immunizations and prophylactic treatment and to reduce behaviors
that may transmit infection.</p>

<p>We recognize that treating patients infected with HIV who
immigrate to the United States will incur costs for the public sector. It is
inequitable, however, to use cost as a reason to exclude people infected with
HIV, for there are no similar exclusionary policies for those with other costly
chronic diseases, such as heart disease or cancer.</p>

<p>Rather than arbitrarily restrict the movement of a subgroup
of infected people, we must dedicate ourselves to the principles of justice,
scientific cooperation, and a global response to the HIV pandemic.</p>It can be inferred from the passage that </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>more
than 3 million HIV-positive people have sought permanent residence in the
United States.</p></li><li><p>countries with a low
seroprevalence of HIV have a disproportionate and unjustified concern over the
spread of AIDS by immigration.</p></li><li><p>the
United States is more concerned with controlling the number of HIV-positive
immigrants than with avoiding criticism from outside its borders.</p></li><li><p>current
law is meeting the demand for prudent handling of a potentially hazardous
international issue.</p></li><li><p>actions by
countries in the western Pacific and Mediterranean regions to restrict travel
are ineffective.</p>

</li></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is an extension question. Lines highlighted in blue state <em>"U.S.
policy has been sharply criticized by national and international
organizations."</em> Given that this
criticism has not caused the United States to change its policies, it must be
more concerned with controlling the number of HIV-positive immigrants than with
avoiding criticism. <strong>The answer, therefore, is (C).</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be tempted by (A); it&rsquo;s a same
language trap. Every word in it is taken from the passage. However, the passage
states that over 3 million people were tested for HIV antibodies (lines 20&ndash;22),
not that they were tested "positive"
for HIV antibodies.</p>
