	<h1>Reading Methods</h1></p>

<p>Reading styles are subjective&mdash;there is no best
method for approaching the passages. "There are as many "systems"
for reading the passages as there are test-prep books"&mdash;all "authoritatively"
promoting their method, while contradicting some aspect of another. A reading
technique that is natural for one person can be awkward and unnatural for
another person. However, "it&rsquo;s hard to believe that many of the
methods advocated in certain books could help anyone". Be that as it may, I will
throw in our my two-cents worth&mdash;though not so dogmatically. </p>

<p>"Some books recommend speed-reading the passages. This is a
mistake. Speed reading is designed for ordinary, nontechnical material. Because
this material is filled with "fluff,"
you can skim over the nonessential parts and still get the gist&mdash;and
often more&mdash;of the passage. As mentioned before, however, GRE passages
are dense. Some are actual quoted articles (when the writers of the GRE find
one that is sufficiently compact). Most often, however, they are based on
articles that have been condensed to about one-third their original length. During
this process no essential information is lost, just the "fluff"
is cut. This is why speed reading will not work here&mdash;the passages
contain too much information. You should, however, read somewhat faster than
you normally do, but not to the point that your comprehension suffers. You will
have to experiment to find your optimum pace.</p>

<p>One technique that you may find helpful is to preview the
passage by reading the first sentence of each paragraph. Generally, the topic
of a paragraph is contained in the first sentence. Reading the first sentence
of each paragraph will give an overview of the passage. The topic sentences act
in essence as a summary of the passage. Furthermore, since each passage is only
three or four paragraphs long, previewing the topic sentences will not use up
an inordinate amount of time. (I don&rsquo;t use this method myself,
however. I prefer to see the passage as a completed whole, and to let the passage
unveil its main idea to me as I become absorbed in it. I find that when I try
to pre-analyze the passage it tends to become disjointed, and I lose my
concentration. Nonetheless, as mentioned before, reading methods are
subjective, so experiment&mdash;this may work for you.)</p>
