	<h1>Mixture Problems</h1></strong></p>

<p>The key to these problems is that the combined total of the
concentrations in the two parts must be the same as the whole mixture.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>
How many ounces of a
solution that is 30 percent salt must be added to a 50-ounce solution that is
10 percent salt so that the resulting solution is 20 percent salt?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>20</p></li><li><p>30</p></li><li><p>40</p></li><li><p>50</p></li><li><p>60</p>

<p></li></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>x</em> be the ounces of the 30 percent solution. Then 30%<em>x</em>
is the amount of salt in that solution. The final solution will be <span class="equation">50 + <em>x</em></span>
ounces, and its concentration of salt will be <span class="equation">20%(50 + <em>x</em>)</span>.
The original amount of salt in the solution is <span class="equation">10%&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;50</span> . Now, the concentration of
salt in the original solution plus the concentration of salt in the added
solution must equal the concentration of salt in the resulting solution:</p>

<p><span class="equation">10%&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;50&nbsp;+&nbsp;30%<em>x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;20%(50&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>x</em>)</span></p>

<p>Multiply this equation by 100 to clear the percent symbol
and then solving for <em>x</em> yields <span class="equation"><em>x</em> = 50.</span>
<strong>The answer is (D).</strong></p>
