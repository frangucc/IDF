	<h1>Points to Remember</h1></p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal"> <li>The order of the passage questions <u>roughly</u>
corresponds to the order in which the issues are presented in the passage. </li>

<li> The six questions are<u</p>

<p></u>Main Idea</p>

<p>Description</p>

<p>Writing Technique </p>

<p>Extension</p>

<p>Application </p>

<p>Tone</p>

</li><li>

The main idea of a passage is usually stated in the last,
sometimes the first, sentence of the first paragraph. If it&rsquo;s not
there, it will probably be the last sentence of the entire passage.</li><li>If after the first reading, you don&rsquo;t have a
feel for the main idea, review the first and last sentence of each paragraph.
</li><li> The answer to a description question must refer directly
to a statement in the passage, not to something implied by it. However, the
correct answer will paraphrase a passage statement, not quote it exactly. In
fact, exact quotes are used with these questions to bait wrong answers. 
</li><li>When answering a description question, you must find the
point in the passage from which the question is drawn.

</li><li>If a description question refers to line 20, the information
needed to answer it can occur anywhere from line 15 to 25.

</li><li> Some writing techniques commonly used in the GRE passages
are

<p>A. Compare and contrast two positions.</p>

<p>B. Show cause and effect.</p>

<p>C. State a position; then give supporting evidence.</p>

</li><li> For extension questions, any answer-choice that refers
explicitly to or repeats a statement in the passage will probably be wrong.

</li><li> Application questions differ from extension questions
only in degree. Extension questions ask you to apply what you have learned from
the passage to derive new information about the same subject, whereas
application questions go one step further, asking you to apply what you have
learned from the passage to a different or hypothetical situation.

</li><li> To answer an application question, take the perspective
of the author. Ask yourself: what am I arguing for? what might make my argument
stronger? what might make it weaker?

</li><li> Because application questions go well beyond the
passage, they tend to be the most difficult.

</li><li>For tone questions, decide whether the writer&rsquo;s
tone is positive, negative, or neutral before you look at the answer-choices. 

</li><li> If you do not have a feel for the writer&rsquo;s
attitude after the first reading, check the adjectives that she chooses.

</li><li> Beware of answer-choices that contain extreme emotions. If
an author&rsquo;s tone is negative, it may be disapproving&mdash;not
snide. Or if her tone is positive, it may be approving&mdash;not ecstatic. 

</li><li>The answers must be indisputable. A correct answer will
never be controversial or grammatically questionable.</p>
