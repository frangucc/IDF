	<h1>Practice</h1></p>

<p>Consider the Argument prompts below and, using the five
steps we have discussed, practice analyzing some arguments.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>The manager at WKAM radio station recently
sent out a memo that included the following:</p>

<p>"At the beginning of this past
year, we removed &rsquo;Fred Kalin&rsquo;s Sports Talk&rsquo; from
the 11:00 news. Since then, our ratings have gone down. Therefore, we will
reinstate Fred&rsquo;s spot so that our ratings will be revived."</p>

<p>The following is from a letter from the
Barrow County School Board:</p>

<p>"Two years ago, we formed a
committee whose sole purpose is to examine area schools and identify potential
problems. This year, the committee&rsquo;s study noted that the 10 worst
schools were run by principals with the least experience. Next year, these
principals will be replaced by people with more experience so that the schools
will begin to improve."</p>

<p>The following appeared in a letter from
Smiler Toothpaste&rsquo;s marketing department to its CEO:</p>

<p>"Glamour Teeth just introduced
Mr. Tooth in their new advertising campaign. Mr. Tooth is a cute cartoon tooth
who encourages everyone to try the new Glamour Teeth toothpaste. Since the new
ad campaign began, sales of the new Glamour Teeth toothpaste have risen 67%. We
should develop our own cartoon mascot to star in a new ad campaign. This would
give our sales the boost they need to compete with or even surpass Glamour
Teeth&rsquo;s sales."</p>

<p>The following appeared in a business plan for
ABC Company, located in Hankville:</p>

<p>"All of the successful small
businesses in the neighboring town of Sharpston are family-owned. Since we are
a small business, if we want to be successful, we should offer employment to
family members of any employees we hire. This will create a more
family-oriented atmosphere."</p>

<p>Health stores get most of their business from
people who are into fitness. Therefore, when considering where to locate, a
health store should open only in towns where sports equipment stores flourish
and fitness centers are full.</p>
