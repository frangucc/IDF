	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>The bitter cold the Midwest is
experiencing is potentially life threatening to <u>stranded motorists unless
well-insulated</u> with protective clothing.</div><div class="options"><ol

motorists unless there is insulation</p></li><li><p>the
stranded motorist unless insulated</p>

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect. As worded, the sentence implies that the cold should be
well-insulated.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is awkward; besides, it still implies that the
cold should be well-insulated.</p>

<p>Choice (D) does not indicate what should be insulated.</p>

<p>Choice (E), like choices (A) and (B), implies that the cold
should be well-insulated.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (C) is the answer</strong> since
it correctly implies that the stranded motorists should be well-insulated with
protective clothing.<strong></p>
