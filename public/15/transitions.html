	<h1>Transitions</h1>
	<p>Transitional phrases are an
important element of style because they create coherence. They guide the reader
from point A to point B. On the GRE, the reader will read through your essay
quickly, scoring according to his first impression of what you wrote. If your
essay is choppy and does not flow well, the reader will not gain a good first
impression. Therefore, it is imperative that your essay exhibits solid
cohesiveness. Look at the lists below for some examples of transitional words
and phrases that will help you write a smooth, coherent essay.</p>

<p><strong>Agreement: </strong>also, plus, in addition, further,
furthermore, moreover, additionally, to add to that, next, in accordance with,
accordingly, in agreement, finally, for instance, for example, in
exemplification, exemplifying that, in fact, factually speaking, in terms of,
and so forth, in coordination with, along those lines, collectively speaking,
generally speaking, indeed, undoubtedly, obviously, to be sure, equally</p>

<p><strong>Contrast: </strong>however, in contrast, on the
contrary, on the other hand, from a different angle, nonetheless, nevertheless,
but, yet, a catch to this is, sadly enough, as a hindrance, oddly enough,
instead, in direct opposition, still, rather</p>

<p><strong>Result: </strong>as a result, as a consequence,
consequently, thus, therefore, hence, thereby, resulting in, ultimately, in the
end, finally, in the overall analysis, in hindsight, in retrospect,
retrospectively, vicariously, the long term effect, as a short term result,
significantly, as a major effect, effectively, heretofore, hereafter,
thereafter, in short, generally, over all, concluding</p>

<p>Transitional words and phrases are helpful
not only in linking your ideas between sentences, but also in providing
cohesiveness from paragraph to paragraph. Each paragraph of your essay should
include a topic sentence, which can also act as a transitional sentence. This
transitional sentence should link your paragraphs by relating to some element
in the preceding paragraph. Take a look at the following example:</p>

<p>The size of your house will probably be a
factor in how you decide to decorate. If you have a large house, you may opt
for a grand, sophisticated look. Over-sized furniture and ornate fixtures will
complement solid-colored walls accented with artwork. On the other hand, a cozy
look suits a smaller home. This look can be achieved by choosing less formal
furniture, simple accents and warm colors. Equally, patterned wall-coverings
add a lovely touch to a small home.</p>

<p><u>Regardless of the size of your house, your
financial situation will also likely play a large role in the style of d&eacute;cor
you choose.</u> Limited funds may force you to make some of your own
decorations, like curtains and knick knacks. However, unlimited funds may offer
the option of hiring an interior decorator to do all the work for you.</p>

<p>The first sentence of the second paragraph is
not only the topic sentence of the paragraph (it lets the reader know what the
paragraph will be about), but also the transitional sentence that links the two
paragraphs. Notice that the phrase "Regardless of
the size of your house" refers to the topic of the
first paragraph, thereby tying together the topics of both paragraphs. In
addition, the word "also"
in this sentence indicates that a second factor of decorating is being
introduced.</p>

<p>Other more subtle transitions occur in the first paragraph.
For example, "over-sized furniture"
in the third sentence refers to the "large house"
in the preceding sentence. This provides a transition without using a
transitional word. Notice further that "large"
is part of the subordinate clause in the second sentence but "over-sized"
is part of the main subject in the third sentence, thus providing transition
while also giving the reader some variety in sentence pattern. (We will discuss
varying your sentences later on.)</p>

<p>More obvious are the transitional words we discussed
previously. In the first paragraph, for example, the phrase "On
the other hand" depicts the contrast between a
large and a small house while "equally"
continues the thoughts pertaining to a cozy home. In the second paragraph, "However"
is used to show contrast in a pattern much like in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Using transitions, both subtle and obvious,
in your sentences and between paragraphs is essential in creating cohesiveness
in your essay. Without this clarity, your essay will likely be choppy and
difficult for the scorer to read and understand. A word of caution, however,
before we move on: Since time is limited on the writing assessment sections,
you must be concise and to the point. Be careful not to overuse transitional
words and phrases because overuse can make you sound like a pedantic writer
rather than an intelligent one.</p>
