</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect since the verb <em>repairing</em> is not parallel
to the verb <em>junk</em>.</p>

<p>In choice (B), the construction <em>have it
junked</em> is awkward. Further, it changes the original construction
from active to passive.</p>

<p>Choice (C) offers a parallel construction (<em>repairing/junking</em>),
but it is awkward.</p>

<p>Choice (D) also offers a parallel construction (<em>repair/junk</em>),
but the construction <em>try and</em> is not idiomatic.</p>

<p>Choice (E) offers a parallel construction (<em>repair/junk</em>),
and the correct idiom&mdash;<em>try to</em>. <strong>The
answer is (E).</p>
