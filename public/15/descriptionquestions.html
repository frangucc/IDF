	<h1>DESCRIPTION QUESTIONS</h1>
	<p>Description questions, as with main idea questions, refer to
a point made by the author. However, description questions refer to a minor
point or to incidental information, not to the author&rsquo;s main point.</p>

 <p><strong>Read the passage slowly to get a good understanding of
the issues.</strong></p>

<p>There are two major systems of criminal
procedure in the modern world&mdash;the adversarial and the inquisitorial. The
former is associated with common law tradition and the latter with civil law
tradition. Both systems were historically preceded by the system of private
vengeance in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
administered it privately, either personally or through an agent. The vengeance
system was a system of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
slogan "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
The modern adversarial system is only one historical step removed from the
private vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic features.
Thus, for example, even though the right to institute criminal action has now
been extended to all members of society and even though the police department
has taken over the pretrial investigative functions on behalf of the
prosecution, the adversarial system still leaves the defendant to conduct his
own pretrial investigation. The trial is still viewed as a duel between two
adversaries, refereed by a judge who, at the beginning of the trial has no
knowledge of the investigative background of the case. In the final analysis
the adversarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the
punitive combat.</p>

<p>By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins historically
where the adversarial system stopped its development. It is two historical
steps removed from the system of private vengeance. Therefore, from the
standpoint of legal anthropology, it is historically superior to the
adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the public investigator has
the duty to investigate not just on behalf of the prosecutor but also on behalf
of the defendant. Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to present
to the court not only evidence that may lead to the conviction of the defendant
but also evidence that may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that
both parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence in their
possession. Finally, in an effort to make the trial less like a duel between
two adversaries, the inquisitorial system mandates that the judge take an
active part in the conduct of the trial, with a role that is both directive and
protective.</p>

<p>Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial system. This
system operates on the philosophical premise that in a criminal case the
crucial factor is not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the
goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the court the
commission of the alleged crime.</p>

<p>Again, these questions take various forms:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal"><li><p>According to the
passage . . . </p></li>

<li><p>In line 37, the author
mentions . . . for the purpose of . . .</p></li>

<li><p>The passage suggests
that which one of the following would . . . </p></li></ol>

<p>The answer to a description question must refer <u>directly</u>
to a statement in the passage, not to something implied by it. However, the
correct answer will paraphrase a statement in the passage, not give an exact
quote. In fact, exact quotes ("Same language"
traps) are often used to bait wrong answers. </p>

<p>Caution: When answering a description question, you must
find the point in the passage from which the question is drawn. Don&rsquo;t
rely on memory&mdash;too many obfuscating tactics are used with these
questions. </p>

<p>Not only must the correct answer refer directly to a
statement in the passage, it must refer to the relevant statement. The correct
answer will be surrounded by wrong choices which refer directly to the passage
but don&rsquo;t address the question. These choices can be tempting because
they tend to be quite close to the actual answer. </p>

<p>Once you spot the sentence to which the question refers, you
still must read a few sentences before and after it, to put the question in
context. If a question refers to line 20, the information needed to answer it
can occur anywhere from line 15 to 25. Even if you have spotted the answer in
line 20, you should still read a couple more lines to make certain you have the
proper perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> (Refer to passage above.)</p>

<p>According to the passage, the inquisitorial system differs
from the adversarial system in that </div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>it
does not make the defendant solely responsible for gathering evidence for his
case</p></li><li><p>it does not require the police
department to work on behalf of the prosecution</p></li><li><p>it
does not allow the victim the satisfaction of private vengeance </p></li><li><p>it
requires the prosecution to drop a weak case</p></li><li><p>a
defendant who is innocent would prefer to be tried under the inquisitorial
system </p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is a description question, so the information needed to answer it must be
stated in the passage&mdash;though not in the same language as in the
answer. The needed information is contained in lines 34&ndash;36, which
state that the public prosecutor has to investigate on behalf of both society
and the defendant. Thus, the defendant is not solely responsible for investigating
his case. Furthermore, the paragraph&rsquo;s opening implies that this
feature is not found in the adversarial system. This illustrates why you must
determine the context of the situation before you can safely answer the
question. <strong>The answer is (A).</strong></p>

<p>The other choices can be easily dismissed. (B)
is the second best answer. Lines 17&ndash;19 state that in the adversarial
system the police assume the work of the prosecution. Then lines 28&ndash;30
state that the inquisitorial system begins where the adversarial system
stopped; this implies that in both systems the police work for the prosecution.
(C) uses a false claim ploy. The passage states that both systems are removed
from the system of private vengeance. (D) is probably true, but it is neither
stated nor directly implied by the passage. Finally, (E) uses a reference to
the passage to make a true but irrelevant statement. People&rsquo;s
attitude or preference toward a system is not a part of that system.</p>

<p><strong>Application: <em>(Mini-passage)</em>
</strong></p>

<p>If dynamic visual graphics, sound effects, and automatic
scorekeeping are the features that account for the popularity of video games,
why are parents so worried? All of these features seem quite innocent. But
another source of concern is that the games available in arcades have, almost
without exception, themes of physical aggression.... There has long been the
belief that violent content may teach violent behavior. And yet again our
society finds a new medium in which to present that content, and yet again the
demand is nearly insatiable. And there is evidence that violent video games
breed violent behavior, just as violent television shows do....</p>

<p>The effects of video violence are less simple, however, than
they at first appeared. The same group of researchers who found negative
effects [from certain video games] have more recently found that two-player
aggressive video games, whether cooperative or competitive, reduce the level of
aggression in children&rsquo;s play....</p>

<p>It may be that the most harmful aspect of the violent video
games is that they are solitary in nature. A two-person aggressive game (video
boxing, in this study) seems to provide a cathartic or releasing effect for
aggression, while a solitary aggressive game (such as Space Invaders) may
stimulate further aggression. Perhaps the effects of television in stimulating
aggression will also be found to stem partly from the fact that TV viewing
typically involves little social interaction.</p>

<p>From Patricia Marks Greenfield, <em>Mind and Media:
The Effects of Television, Video Games, and Computers. </em>  1984 by
Harvard University Press.</p>

<p>According to the passage, which of the following would be
likely to stimulate violent behavior in a child playing a video game?</p>

<p> I. Watching the computer stage a battle between two
opponents</p>

<p> II. Controlling a character in battle against a computer</p>

<p> III. Challenging another player to a battle in a
non-cooperative two-person game</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>II
only</p></li><li><p>III only</p></li><li><p>I
and II only</p></li><li><p>II and III only</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:<br>
</span><strong>Item
I, True:</strong> Stimulation would occur. This choice is qualitatively
the same as passively watching violence on television.<br> 
<strong>Item II,
True:</strong> Stimulation would also occur. This is another example of
solitary aggression (implied by the second sentence of the last paragraph).<br> 
<strong>Item
III, False:</strong> No stimulation would occur. Two-player aggressive
games are "cathartic"
(again the needed reference is the second sentence of the last paragraph). <strong>The
answer is (C).</strong>

<p>Often you will be asked to define a word or phrase based on
its context. For this type of question, again you must look at a few lines
before and after the word. <u>Don&rsquo;t</u> assume that
because the word is familiar you know the definition requested. Words often
have more than one meaning, and the GRE often asks for a peculiar or technical
meaning of a common word. For example, as a noun <em>champion</em>
means "the winner," but
as a verb <em>champion</em> means "to
be an advocate for someone." You must consider the
word&rsquo;s context to get its correct meaning.</p>

<p>On the GRE the definition of a word will not use as simple a
structure as was used above to define <em>champion</em>. One common
way the GRE introduces a defining word or phrase is to place it in <u>apposition</u>
to the word being defined.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse "apposition"
with "opposition": they
have antithetical [exactly opposite] meanings. Words or phrases in <u>apposition</u>
are placed next to each other, and the second word or phrase defines,
clarifies, or gives evidence for the first word or phrase. The second word or
phrase will be set off from the first by a comma, semicolon, hyphen, or
parentheses. (Note: If a comma is not followed by a linking word&mdash;such
as <em>and, for, yet&mdash;</em>then the following phrase is
probably appositional.)</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>The discussions were acrimonious, frequently degenerating
into name-calling contests.</p>

<p>After the comma in this sentence, there is no linking word
(such as <em>and, but, because, although</em>, etc.). Hence the
phrase following the comma is in apposition to <em>acrimonious</em>&mdash;it
defines or further clarifies the word. Now acrimonious means bitter,
mean-spirited talk, which would aptly describe a name-calling contest.</p>

<p><strong>Application:
<em>(Mini-passage)</em> </strong></p>

<p>The technical phenomenon, embracing all the separate
techniques, forms a whole.... It is useless to look for differentiations. They
do exist, but only secondarily. The common features of the technical phenomenon
are so sharply drawn that it is easy to discern that which is the technical
phenomenon and that which is not.</p>

<p>... To analyze these common features is tricky, but it is
simple to grasp them. Just as there are principles common to things as
different as a wireless set and an internal-combustion engine, so the
organization of an office and the construction of an aircraft have certain
identical features. This identity is the primary mark of that thoroughgoing
unity which makes the technical phenomenon a single essence despite the extreme
diversity of its appearances.</p>

<p>As a corollary, it is impossible to analyze this or that
element out of it&mdash;a truth which is today particularly misunderstood. The
great tendency of all persons who study techniques is to make distinctions. They
distinguish between the different elements of technique, maintaining some and
discarding others. They distinguish between technique and the use to which it
is put. These distinctions are completely invalid and show only that he who
makes them has understood nothing of the technical phenomenon. Its parts are
ontologically tied together; in it, use is inseparable from being.</p>

<p>From Jacques Ellul, <em>The Technological
Society</em>,  1964 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.</p>

<p>The "technical phenomenon"
referred to in the opening line can best be defined as</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>all
of the machinery in use today</p></li><li><p>the
abstract idea of the machine</p></li><li><p>a way of
thinking in modern society</p></li><li><p>what all
machines have in common</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span><strong>(</strong>A):
No, it is clear from the passage that the technical phenomenon is more abstract
than that, since it is described in the opening paragraph as uniting all the
separate "techniques"
(not machines) and as comprising the "features"
that such things as an office and an aircraft have in common. (B): No, the
passage states that the technical phenomenon is something that includes both
techniques and their use (See closing lines of the passage); it is thus broader
that just the idea of machinery. <strong>(C): Yes</strong>, this
seems to be the best answer; it is broad enough to include both techniques and
their uses and abstract enough to go beyond talking only about machines. (D): No,
the passage suggests that it is something that techniques have in common and
techniques can include airplanes or offices.<strong></p>
