class="solution">Solution:</span>The
set of numbers greater than 5 and divisible by 5 is {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, .
. .}. Since n is odd, the possible values for n are 15, 25, 35, . . . . Any
number in this list, when divided by 10, leaves a remainder of 5. <br>Hence, the
value in Column A is 5. <strong>The answer is (C).</strong></p>
