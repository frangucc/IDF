	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p><u>The rising cost</u> of government
bureaucracy have made it all but impossible to reign in the budget deficit.</div><div

cost</p>

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect because the plural verb <em>have</em> does not
agree with its singular subject <em>the rising cost</em>.</p>

<p>Both (B) and (C) are incorrect because they turn the
sentence into a fragment.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is incorrect because <em>rising
cost</em> is still singular.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (D) is the correct
answer</strong> since now the plural verb <em>have</em>
agrees with its plural subject <em>the rising costs</em>.<strong></p>
