	<h1>Quantitative Comparisons</h1>

<p>Quantitative comparisons make up one-half of the math
portion of the GRE. This is good news because they are the easiest problems to
improve on.</p>

<p>Generally, quantitative comparison questions require much
less calculating than do multiple-choice questions. But they are trickier.</p>

<p>Substitution is very effective with quantitative comparison
problems. But you must plug in all five major types of numbers: positives,
negatives, fractions, 0, and 1. Test 0, 1, 2, &ndash;2, and 1/2, in that
order.</p>
