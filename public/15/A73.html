class="solution">Solution:</span>Statement
I is true: From <em>"If p is divided by 2,
the remainder is 1,"</em> <em>p</em>
= 2<em>u</em> + 1; and from <em>"if
q is divided by 6, the remainder is 1,"</em> <span class="equation"><em>q</em>
= 6<em>v</em> + 1</span>. <br>Hence, <em>pq</em> + 1 =</p>

<p>(2<em>u</em> + 1)(6<em>v</em> + 1) +
1 =</p>

<p>12<em>uv</em> + 2<em>u</em> + 6<em>v</em>
+ 1 + 1 =</p>

<p>12<em>uv</em> + 2<em>u</em> + 6<em>v</em>
+ 2 =</p>

<p>2(6<em>uv</em> + <em>u</em> + 3<em>v</em>
+ 1)</p>

<p>Since we have written <em>pq</em> + 1 as a
multiple of 2, it is even.</p>

<p><strong>Method II</strong></p>

<p>Since <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>
each leave a remainder of 1 when divided by an even number, both are odd. Now,
the product of two odd numbers is another odd number. <br>Hence, <em>pq</em>
is odd, and therefore <em>pq</em> + 1 is even.</p>

<p>Now, since <em>pq</em> + 1 is even, <em>pq</em>
is odd. <br>Hence, <em>pq</em>/2 is not an integer, and Statement II is
not necessarily true. <br>Next, Statement III is not necessarily true. <br>
For example,
if <em>p</em> = 3 and <em>q</em> = 7, then <em>pq</em>
= 21, which is not a multiple of 12. <strong>The answer is
(A).</strong></p>
