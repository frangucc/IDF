	<h1>Analyze an Argument</h1></p>

<p>The <em>Analyze an Argument</em> section of the
test requires you to critique an argument and discuss the logical soundness of
it. You are not required to agree or disagree with it. You have 30 minutes to
plan and write your critique. Following is the grading scale for the Argument
