class="solution">Solution:</span>The
word "both" in the
statement implies there are two different types of sunscreen. Since one is
internal, the other one should be external or at least of a different type. The
choices "territorial," "atmospheric,"
and "regional" do not
imply the opposite of internal. "Polar"
and "tropical" may
indicate other varieties. Sunscreens are not used in polar regions; they are
used in tropical regions. <br>Hence, <strong>the answer is
(B).</strong></p>
