class="solution">Solution:</span> Since
the question asks for the <em>smallest</em> prime greater then 48,
we start with the smallest answer-choice. Now, 49 is not prime since <span class="equation">49&nbsp;=&nbsp;7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7</span>. <br>Next, 50 is not prime since <span class="equation">50&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10</span>. <br>Next, 51 is not prime since <span class="equation">51&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;17</span>. <br>Next, 52 is not prime since <span class="equation">52&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;26</span>. Finally, 53 <em>is</em>
prime since it is divisible by only itself and 1. <strong>The answer is
(E).</strong></p>

<p>Note, an integer is prime if it greater than 1 and divisible
by only itself and 1. The number 2 is the smallest prime (and the only even
prime) because the only integers that divide into it evenly are 1 and 2. The
number 3 is the next larger prime. The number 4 is not prime because <span class="equation">4&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2</span>. Following is a partial list
of the prime numbers. You should memorize it.</p>

<p>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, . . .</p>
