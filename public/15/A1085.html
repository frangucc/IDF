</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect. Since <em>United States</em> is denoting the
collective country, it is singular and therefore cannot be correctly referred
to by the plural pronoun <em>they</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is not technically incorrect, but it lacks
precision since it does not state who enacted the Marshall Plan. Further, it
uses a passive construction: <em> was enacted."</em></p>

<p>Choice (C) states who enacted the Marshall Plan, but it
retains the passive construction <em> was enacted."</em></p>

<p>Choice (E) is second-best. The phrase <em> in order"</em>
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Choice (D) corrects the false reference by replacing <em>they</em>
with <em>the United States</em>. Further, it uses the active verb <em>enacted</em>
instead of the passive verb <em>was enacted</em>. <strong>The
answer is (D).</p>
