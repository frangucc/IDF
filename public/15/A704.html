of the answer-choices are nouns, so TABLE cannot be referring to furniture. As
a verb, TABLE means "to postpone."

answer is (E).</strong> </p>

<p>Choice (D), "propound,"
is second-best. However, "expedite"
is more precisely opposite because it includes the notion of speeding up the
consideration of a proposal.</p>
