<div class="passage">
<p>In the United States the per capita costs of schooling have
risen almost as fast as the cost of medical treatment. But increased treatment
by both doctors and teachers has shown steadily declining results. <span class="highlight">Medical
expenses concentrated on those above forty-five have doubled several times over
a period of forty years with a resulting 3 percent</span> increase in the life
expectancy of men. The increase in educational expenditures has produced even
stranger results; otherwise President Nixon could not have been moved this
spring to promise that every child shall soon have the "Right
to Read" before leaving school.</p>

<p>In the United States it would take eighty billion dollars
per year to provide what educators regard as equal treatment for all in grammar
and high school. This is well over twice the $36 billion now being spent. Independent
cost projections prepared at HEW and at the University of Florida indicate that
by 1974 the comparable figures will be $107 billion as against the $45 billion
now projected, and these figures wholly omit the enormous costs of what is
called "higher education,"
for which demand is growing even faster. The United States, which spent nearly
eighty billion dollars in 1969 for "defense,"
including its deployment in Vietnam, is obviously too poor to provide equal
schooling. The President&rsquo;s committee for the study of school finance
should ask not how to support or how to trim such increasing costs, but how
they can be avoided.</p>

<p>Equal obligatory schooling must be recognized as at least
economically unfeasible. In Latin America the amount of public money spent on
each graduate student is between 350 and 1,500 times the amount spent on the
median citizen (that is, the citizen who holds the middle ground between the
poorest and the richest). In the United States the discrepancy is smaller, but
the discrimination is keener. The richest parents, some 10 percent, can afford
private education for their children and help them to benefit from foundation
grants. But in addition they obtain ten times the per capita amount of public
funds if this is compared with the per capita expenditure made on the children
of the 10 percent who are poorest. The principal reasons for this are that rich
children stay longer in school, that a year in a university is
disproportionately more expensive than a year in high school, and that most
private universities depend&mdash;at least indirectly&mdash;on
tax-derived finances.</p>

<p>Obligatory schooling inevitably polarizes a society; it also
grades the nations of the world according to an international caste system. Countries
are rated like castes whose educational dignity is determined by the average
years of schooling of its citizens, a rating which is closely related to per
capita gross national product, and much more painful.</p><p>According to the passage, education is like
health care in all of the following ways EXCEPT:</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>It
has reached a point of diminishing returns, increased spending no longer
results in significant improvement. </p></li><li><p> It has an inappropriate "more
is better" philosophy.</p></li><li><p> It is unfairly distributed between rich and poor.</p></li><li><p> The amount of money being spent on older students is
increasing.</p></li><li><p> Its cost has increased nearly as fast.</p></li></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is a description question, so we must find the place from which it is drawn. It
is the first paragraph. The sentence <em>"But
increased treatment by both doctors and teachers has shown steadily declining
results"</em> shows that both have reached a
point of diminishing returns. This eliminates (A) and (B). <br>Next, the passage
states <em>"Medical expenses concentrated on
those above forty-five have doubled several
times"</em> (lines highlighted in blue) and that
the demand and costs of higher education are growing faster than the demand and
costs of elementary and high school education. This eliminates (D). <br>Next, the
opening to the passage states that the costs of education <em>"have
risen almost as fast as the cost of medical
treatment."</em> This eliminates (E). <br>Hence,
by process of elimination, <strong>the answer is (C).</strong> We
should, however, verify this. In paragraph three, the author does state that
there is a "keen"
discrepancy in the funding of education between rich and poor, but a survey of
the passage shows that at no point does he mention that this is also the case
with health care.</p>
