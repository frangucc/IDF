	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>The Democrats have accused the
Republicans of resorting to dirty tricks by planting a mole on the Democrat&rsquo;s
planning committee and then <u>used the information obtained to sabotage</u> the
Democrat&rsquo;s campaign.</div><div class="options"><ol

using the information they had obtained to sabotage</p></li><li><p>using
the information obtained to sabotage</p></li><li><p>to
have used the information obtained to sabotage</p>

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect because the simple past <em>obtained</em> does not
express the fact that the information was gotten before another past action&mdash;the
sabotage.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is incorrect because <em>used</em> is
not parallel to <em>of resorting</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (C) is correct</strong> because
the phrase <em>of using</em> is parallel to the phrase <em>of</em>
<em>resorting</em>. Further, the past perfect <em>had
obtained</em> correctly expresses that a past action&mdash;the spying&mdash;was
completed before another past action&mdash;the sabotage.</p>

<p>Choice (D) is incorrect because <em>using</em>
is not parallel to <em>of resorting</em> and the past perfect is
not used.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is incorrect because <em>to have
used</em> is not parallel to <em>of resorting</em> and the
past perfect is not used.<strong></p>
