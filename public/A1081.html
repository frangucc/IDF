class="solution">Solution:</span>The
sentence implies that the location, though having splendid natural settings, is
distressed by the ongoing battle. We can observe from the structure of the
sentence that both blanks explain the natural beauty of the location. The
author implies that if the location had no overtones of the battlefield, it
would have been a "picturesque"
airfield in an "exquisite"
part of the North. <strong>The answer is (D).</strong></p>
