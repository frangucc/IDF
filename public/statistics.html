	<h1>STATISTICS</h1></strong></p>

<p>Statistics is the study of the patterns and relationships of
numbers and data. There are four main concepts that may appear on the test:</p>

<p><strong>Median</strong></p>

<p>When a set of numbers is arranged in order of size, the median
is the middle number. For example, the median of the set {8, 9, 10, 11, 12} is 10
because it is the middle number. In this case, the median is also the mean
(average). But this is usually not the case. For example, the median of the set<br>

{8, 9, 10, 11, 17} is 10 because it is the middle number, but the mean is <span class="equation">11&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                    
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;9&nbsp;+&nbsp;10&nbsp;+&nbsp;11&nbsp;+&nbsp;17&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>
</span>
 . If a
set contains an even number of elements, then the median is the average of the
two middle elements. For example, the median of the set {1, 5, 8, 20} is 
<span class="equation">6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5(=&nbsp;<span class="frac">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                    
<tr>
<td class="num">&nbsp;5&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="den">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table></span>)
</span>
 .
 </p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>
What is the median of
0, &ndash;2, 256 , 18, <span class="equation">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span>
</span>
 ?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:<br>
</strong>Arranging the numbers from smallest to largest (we could
also arrange the numbers from the largest to smallest; the answer would be the
same), we get &ndash;2, 0, <span class="equation">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span>
</span>
 , 18, 256. The median is the
middle number, <span class="equation">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span>
</span> .</p>

<p><strong>Mode</strong></p>

<p>The mode is the number or numbers that
appear most frequently in a set. Note that this definition allows a set of
numbers to have more than one mode.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>
What is the mode of 3,
&ndash;4, 3 , 7, 9, 7.5 ?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  <br>
</strong>The number 3 is the mode because it is the only number that
is listed more than once.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>
What is the mode of 2,
&#960;, 2 , &ndash;9, &#960;, 5?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong>Both 2 and &#960; are modes because each occurs twice, which
is the greatest number of occurrences for any number in the list.</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong></p>

<p>The range is the distance between the
smallest and largest numbers in a set. To calculate the range, merely subtract
the smallest number from the largest number.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>
What is the range of
2, 8, 1 , &ndash;6, &#960;, 1/2 ?</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong><br>
  The largest number in this set is 8, and the smallest number
is &ndash;6. Hence, the range is <span class="equation">8 &ndash; (&ndash;6) = 8 + 6 = 14.</span></p>

<p><strong>Standard Deviation</strong></p>

<p>On the test, you are not expected to know the definition of
standard deviation. However, you may be presented with the definition of
standard deviation and then be asked a question based on the definition. To
make sure we cover all possible bases, we&rsquo;ll briefly discuss this
concept.</p>

<p>Standard deviation measures how far the
numbers in a set vary from the set&rsquo;s mean. If the numbers are
scattered far from the set&rsquo;s mean, then the standard deviation is
large. If the numbers are bunched up near the set&rsquo;s mean, then the
standard deviation is small.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>
<br>
Which of the following
sets has the larger standard deviation? </p>

<p>A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>

<p>B = {1, 4, 15, 21, 27}</p>

<p><strong>Solution:  </strong><br>
  All the numbers in Set A are within 2 units of the mean, 3. All
the numbers in Set&nbsp;B are greater than 5 units from the mean, 15. Hence,
the standard deviation of Set&nbsp;B is greater.</p>
