<p><strong>Column A</strong><br>The surface area of a cone with radius 3</p>

	<li><p>Not enough information to decide.</p></li></ol></div>
	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> Since
we don&rsquo;t know the radius of the cone in Column A, the cone can be as
wide or as narrow as we want. <br>Hence, the surface area can be a large or small
as we want. Similarly, since we don&rsquo;t know the height of the cone in
Column B, the surface area can be as large or small as we want. <br>Hence, there is
not enough information to decide which column is larger. <strong>The
answer is (D).</strong></p>
