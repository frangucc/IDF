	<h1>Sample Issues & Essays</h1></p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s apply the 7 steps to three examples.</p>

<p><u>Example 1: Comparison &ndash; Contrast
Essay</u></p>

<p>Prompt: "A new
custom home is a much better purchase than an older, run-down home."</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &ndash; Understanding the
Issue</p>

<p>&bull; What does the statement mean? <em>If
you are in the market to buy a house, a new home would be a better
value.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is the issue at hand? <em>What
kind of home is the best to buy?</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is implied by the statement? <em>That
one who purchases an old home is not making a wise choice. Also implied is that
an older home is run-down.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is the writer&rsquo;s stand on
the issue? <em>He believes a new home is superior to an old
one.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What, if any, evidence does the writer use
to support his position? <em>Old houses are run-down, new homes can be
custom built.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> &ndash; Choosing My
Pattern of Development</p>

<p>This prompt requires me to employ the Comparison &ndash;
Contrast pattern of development because the statement uses the word "than,"
a contrasting word. Moreover, the author is trying to convince me that it is
better to buy a new home than an old one.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> &ndash; Developing My
Thesis</p>

<p>THESIS FOR COMPARISON &ndash; CONTRAST ESSAY <em>(formula
1-1)</em>:</p>

<p>I believe that Item A, <u>an old home</u>, is
better than Item B, <u>a new home</u>, because </p>

<p>1) <u>an old home exemplifies old-style motifs that
are unique in today&rsquo;s market</u>, 2) <u>foundations are
stronger in older homes</u>, 3) <u>can remodel an old home in any
way</u>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> &ndash; Understanding
Counter Argument</p>

<p>COMPARISON &ndash; CONTRAST COUNTER CLAIM <em>(formula
2-1)</em>:</p>

<p>Others may think Item B is better than Item A because 1) <u>you
can "keep up with the
Joneses" with your modern d&eacute;cor</u>, 2) <u>new
homes may be built quickly for easy occupancy</u>, 3) <u>new homes
can be custom-built</u>. (Note that these three points should contrast
directly with the three points of your thesis. (see <em>formula
1-1</em>))</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> &ndash; Organizing My
Thoughts</p>

<p>COMPARISON &ndash; CONTRAST ESSAY FORMULA <em>(formula
3-1)</em>:</p>

<p>I. Introduction &ndash; Paragraph 1</p>

<p>A. Some people feel that the purchase of a new home is a
smarter investment choice than the purchase of an older home.</p>

<p>B. For anyone who puts stock in the aged and unique, the
traditional home may be the choice of a lifetime with its old-fashioned motifs,
its strong foundations, and its versatility to become the house its owner
designs.</p>

<p>II. Support &ndash; Paragraph 2</p>

<p>A. keeping up with the Joneses &ndash; modern d&eacute;cor</p>

<p>B. bring back old-time motifs</p>

<p>1. More choices &ndash; can choose from different time
periods</p>

<p>2. More unique versus "cookie
cutter" homes of today</p>

<p>III. Support &ndash; Paragraph 3</p>

<p>A. Homes can be built quicker</p>

<p>B. As a result, foundations not as strong in new homes</p>

<p>1. Mass production of homes &ndash; builder doesn&rsquo;t
establish good foundation</p>

<p>2. Older homes in better condition over long period of time
because built more solidly</p>

<p>IV. Support &ndash; Paragraph 4</p>

<p>A. Custom-built</p>

<p>B. Can remodel any way owner wants</p>

<p>1. No allowance restrictions placed on owner by builder</p>

<p>V. Conclusion &ndash; Paragraph 5</p>

<p>A. Modern homes just don&rsquo;t offer the old-fashioned
charm an older well-built, unique home can offer.</p>

<p>B. When it comes to such an important decision as purchasing
a home, the choice is clear: an older home has much more to offer and will last
for many years to come. </p>

<p>Step 6 &ndash; Writing My Essay</p>

<p>Modern-day housing developments are springing up everywhere,
dotting hills and filling in every open space available. Characterized by "cookie
cutter" homes, houses all cut from the same mold,
the look of these communities lacks distinctiveness. For anyone who puts stock
in the aged and unique rather than the new and ordinary, the traditional house
may be the choice of a lifetime with its old-fashioned motifs, its strong
foundations, and its versatility to become the home of its owner&rsquo;s
design.</p>

<p>Many homeowners do not feel the need to be the designer
behind their home. Rather, they strive to "keep up
with the Joneses" by filling their houses with the
same modern d&eacute;cor that fills the homes of their neighbors. On the flip side,
when seeking to invest in a traditional home, the buyer has a plethora of
options because older homes offer so much uniqueness. This uniqueness can be
seen in the motifs of style, which are almost non-existent in today&rsquo;s
market of prefabricated homes but are powerful reminders of days gone by in
older structures. These are the structures that offer a homeowner an admirable
individuality. </p>

<p>Clearly, modern-day homes, which lack individuality, are
built more quickly than homes of the past, a fact that seems to fit today&rsquo;s
hurried society. But what does a homeowner have to show for this efficiency
years down the road? There is much value added to a home constructed by a
builder who takes time and pays attention to detail instead of putting up as
many homes as possible in the shortest amount of time possible. For example, in
the past when builders did take extra time and care, the foundations and
overall structures were, and still are, much stronger. This is because many
builders today, eager to make a quick buck, do not give homes ample time to "settle"
on their foundation before continuing with the construction. Overall, older
houses are in better condition, even over the course of time, because they were
more solidly built.</p>

<p>Many prospective buyers today overlook the quality of a home&rsquo;s
structure and are compelled to purchase by the alluring idea of "custom
building" their house. These homebuyers enjoy the
process of choosing paint colors, fixtures and floor coverings. Consider an
older home, however. Here the possibilities are endless, and traditional buyers
may even negotiate remodeling into the price of the house. What is more, there
are no spending restrictions which contemporary builders often impose on their
buyers. </p>

<p>Spending restrictions represent just one of many ways that
freedom is limited when purchasing a new home instead of an older home. Whether
one prefers an elegant, plantation-style mansion or a peaceful, rustic country
getaway, the distinctive older home has much more to offer than the commonplace
modern home set in communities of houses that all look the same. Simply put, it
comes down to whether the prospective buyer is willing to trade quality and
originality for expediency.</p>

<p>Step 7 &ndash; Revising My Essay</p>

<p>When critiquing other essays, you often learn a lot about
the strengths and weaknesses in your own writing. So here&rsquo;s an
assignment: Let&rsquo;s take our revision questions; your job is to
complete the task required for each question.</p>

<p>&bull; Is the introduction
captivating? Why or why not? Do you recognize a certain method the author
employed to make the introduction interesting? </p>

<p>&bull; Is the thesis statement
concise? Does it clearly show the purpose of the essay?</p>

<p>&bull; Do the body paragraphs
clearly support each point made in the thesis? If not, where does the essay
lack necessary support?</p>

<p>&bull; Are there logical
transitions that make the text flow smoothly between sentences and between
paragraphs? Underline each word, phrase or sentence that acts as a transition.</p>

<p>&bull; Is the tone and diction
consistent throughout the essay? If not, point out the places where consistency
breaks down.</p>

<p>&bull; Is the use of person
consistent? If not, point out the places where consistency is not maintained.</p>

<p>&bull; Is there a word, or are
there words, which have been used too often in the essay? List these words.
Also list the words that have been used to provide variety in the essay.</p>

<p>&bull; Do the sentences vary in
length and structure?</p>

<p><u>Example 2: Cause &ndash; Effect Essay</p>

<p></u></strong>Prompt: "Students
should not be required to take courses outside their field of study."</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &ndash; Understanding the
Issue<u></p>

<p></u>&bull; What does the
statement mean?<em> Colleges should not make students take courses, like
General Education courses, if they do not pertain to their area of
study.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is the issue at hand? <em>Whether
or not students benefit from taking college courses that don&rsquo;t
pertain to their major.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is implied by the statement? <em>That
a student will be adequately prepared for the "real
world" without taking a wide range of
classes.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is the writer&rsquo;s stand on
the issue? <em>That students should not be required to take these
classes.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What, if any, evidence does the writer use
to support his position? <em>The writer does not give any evidence to
support his view.</em><u></p>

<p></u><strong>Step 2</strong> &ndash; Choosing
My Pattern of Development<u></p>

<p></u>This prompt is a "call
for action" statement, and, although no effect is
discussed, the writer implies that his recommended course of action would
result in a positive effect.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> &ndash; Developing My
Thesis<u></p>

<p></u>THESIS FOR CAUSE-EFFECT ESSAY <em>(formula
1-2)</em>:</p>

<p>If <u>students are not required to take courses
outside their field of study</u>, then <u>they will not be
prepared</u>, because 1) <u>they will be ill-prepared if they fail
to get a job in their field</u>, 2) <u>they will be lacking in
important skills &ndash; communication or thinking/reasoning
skills</u>, 3) <u>they will be close-minded and ignorant to things
happening in the world around them</u>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> &ndash; Understanding
Counter Argument</p>

<p>CAUSE &ndash; EFFECT COUNTER CLAIM <em>(formula
2-2)</em>:<u></p>

<p></u>Some may feel that <u>requiring students to
take courses only in their field of study</u> would cause <u>students
to be more knowledgeable in their field</u> because <u>they would
have more thoroughly studied this area</u>.</p>

<p>(Note that this point should contrast directly with point #1
of your thesis. (see <em>formula 1-2</em>))</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> &ndash; Organizing My
Thoughts</p>

<p>CAUSE - EFFECT ESSAY FORMULA <em>(formula
3-2)</em>:</p>

<p>I. Introduction &ndash; Paragraph 1</p>

<p>A. Some feel students should not be required to take courses
outside their field of study.</p>

<p>B. If students are not required to take courses outside
their field of study, they will be ill-prepared should they fail to get a job
in their field, they will lack important skills, and they will be close-minded
and ignorant to things happening in the world around them.</p>

<p>II. Support &ndash; Paragraph 2</p>

<p>A. Some may feel that requiring students to take courses
only in their field of study would cause students to be more knowledgeable in
their field because they would have more thoroughly studied this area.</p>

<p>B. Many people are unable to get a job in their field after
they graduate.</p>

<p>1. Without some knowledge of other fields, these highly
trained people will be stuck working menial jobs.</p>

<p>III. They will be lacking in important skills.</p>

<p>A. Students studying the sciences will lack communication
skills.</p>

<p>B. Students studying the arts will lack critical thinking
and reasoning skills.</p>

<p>IV. They will be close-minded and ignorant of things
happening in the world around them.</p>

<p>A. Lack of familiarity with certain fields promotes
disinterest in these topics as they pertain to current events (politics,
scientific research).</p>

<p>B. This disinterest promotes apathy in participating in or
supporting causes that result from these current events.</p>

<p>V. Conclusion &ndash; Paragraph 5</p>

<p>A. Students must take a well-rounded schedule of classes in
order to be prepared for work outside their field and so they will have
adequate skills to use toward a common interest in society.</p>

<p>C. Students should welcome an opportunity to learn about all
areas of study.</p>

<p>Step 6 &ndash; Writing My Essay</p>

<p>Colleges and universities require students,
regardless of their majors, to complete General Education courses, basic
courses that cover general subject areas. These classes include basic
literature and writing courses, basic science and math courses, and basic arts
classes like music and drama. Some feel students should not be required to take
these General Education classes. However, if students are not required to take
courses outside their major, they will be ill-prepared should they fail to get
a job in their field, they will lack important skills, and they will be
close-minded and ignorant of things happening in the world around them.</p>

<p>Many opponents of General Education classes are themselves
unaware of the advantages of a well-rounded education. They focus only on the
theory that students will be more fully prepared to enter their field as a
result of more extensive study in their area. What they fail to see, however,
is that many graduates are not able to find jobs in their field of expertise.
So, without a broad range of knowledge, these highly trained graduates would be
stuck in menial jobs.</p>

<p>Even if graduates do get jobs within their field, such a
wide range of skills are required in the workplace in order to be successful
that, without a diverse educational background, a graduate will not be fully
competent in any job. For example, when a graduate begins looking for a job,
she will discover that excellent communication skills are invaluable in the
workplace, both in dealing with customers and with colleagues. Without some
base of communication knowledge, such as a student would receive in a basic
English class, the candidate will be overlooked for someone who does show
strength in communication. Moreover, most jobs require strong problem-solving
skills, skills that develop from learning how to think and reason critically.
These skills are reinforced in math and science classes.</p>

<p>Lack of familiarity in certain educational arenas, like math
and science, results in a provincial attitude. This lack of familiarity leads
to disinterest in the areas where a student has not gained knowledge. Likewise,
this disinterest leads to apathy in participating or supporting any causes that
are linked to these fields of study. For example, a student who has not studied
science will be indifferent to scientific ideas, ideas which could become
theories and could help all of mankind. A student who does not study politics
and government will likely be apathetic toward participating in important political
events such as elections. </p>

<p>It is important that a country&rsquo;s citizens take
part in supporting causes and concepts that generate a common interest in
society. Without a well-rounded schedule of classes in college, however, the
citizen base will soon be filled with people who are unprepared and indifferent
to anything that does not directly pertain to their area of interest. Instead
of complaining about an opportunity to gain a broad range of knowledge,
students should consider it a privilege and an asset.</p>

<p><u>Example 3: Definition Essay</p>

<p></u></strong>Prompt: "The
positive effects of competition in a society far outweigh the negative effects."</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &ndash; Understanding the
Issue<u></p>

<p></u>&bull; What does the
statement mean?<em> Competition affects society in a good way, not a bad
way.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is the issue at hand? <em>Whether
or not competition is good for society.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is implied by the statement? <em>That
a society benefits from competition amongst its members.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What is the writer&rsquo;s stand on
the issue? <em>That competition is good and provides benefits.</em></p>

<p>&bull; What, if any, evidence does the writer use
to support his position? <em>The writer does not give any evidence to
support his view.</em><u></p>

<p></u><strong>Step 2</strong> &ndash; Choosing
My Pattern of Development<u></p>

<p></u>Although the comparison between a
society driven by competition and one where competition plays little or no role
seems to hint that the Comparison-Contrast method should be used, the
Definition pattern of development is a better fit because it is necessary to
look at the qualities of <em>competition</em> that make it a
positive influence rather than a negative one.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> &ndash; Developing My
Thesis<u></p>

<p></u>THESIS FOR DEFINITION ESSAY <em>(formula
1-3)</em>:</p>

<p>By definition, <u>competition</u> possesses
these qualities: 1) <u>gives everyone the same chance at the
beginning</u>, 2) <u>drives people to succeed</u>, 3) <u>provides
a way to recognize people who advance</u> which have a positive effect
because A) <u>no one can use the excuse that they didn&rsquo;t have
the same opportunities; everyone has a chance to succeed</u>, B) <u>people
want to be the best, and gives everyone their
"place" in
life</u>, C) <u>gives self-worth to those who are recognized for
their accomplishments</u>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> &ndash; Understanding
Counter Argument</p>

<p>DEFINITION <em>(formula 2-3)</em>:</p>

<p>By definition, some may feel that <u>competition helps
only a few/pushing only a few to the top, leaving others feeling left out or
insignificant</u> which could be positive or <u><strong>negative</strong></u>.</p>

<p>(Note that this point should contrast directly with point #1
of your thesis. (see <em>formula 1-3</em>))</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> &ndash; Organizing My
Thoughts</p>

<p>DEFINITION ESSAY FORMULA <em>(formula
3-3)</em>:</p>

<p>I. Introduction &ndash; Paragraph 1</p>

<p>A. Competition benefits a society.</p>

<p>B. Everyone is given a chance to succeed in a society where
competition drives people to be the best and recognizes the accomplishments of
the many who advance.</p>

<p>II. Support &ndash; Paragraph 2</p>

<p>A. Some feel that competition helps only a few, leaving
others feeling left out or insignificant. There is a push to eliminate
salutatorian/valedictorian recognition speeches at graduation.</p>

<p>B. Competition gives everyone the same chance at the
beginning.</p>

<p>1. Just like a marathon &ndash; everyone begins at the
same starting line.</p>

<p>2. No one has an excuse &ndash; it is up to each
individual to decide how to run the race. Some want to work harder than others
and therefore deserve recognition.</p>

<p>III. Competition drives people to be their best</p>

<p>A. Everyone&rsquo;s "best"
is different.</p>

<p>B. Gives everyone their place in life &ndash; if no
competition, we&rsquo;d have a world full of custodians, no CEO&rsquo;s
or vice versa.</p>

<p>IV. With competition comes the chance to recognize winners.</p>

<p>A. Gives self-worth to those recognized, causing them to set
even greater goals.</p>

<p>B. Encourages those who were not recognized to try harder so
that they too may be recognized.</p>

<p>V. Conclusion &ndash; Paragraph 5</p>

<p>A. Competition is vital to a growing and thriving society.</p>

<p>B. How will you run the race? Will you strive to be the
best?</p>

<p>Step 6 &ndash; Writing My Essay</p>

<p><em>On your mark!</em> All the
runners are at the starting line. <em>Get set!</em> The runners are
poised, in position. <em>Go!</em> The runners take off. The spirit
of competition is the driving force behind these runners&rsquo; desire to
win. And, as an integral part of a society, competition brings many benefits.
Everyone is given a chance to succeed in a society where competition drives
people to be their best, and competition recognizes the accomplishments of
those who advance.</p>

<p>Some feel that, although competition recognizes winners,
there are so few winners that many are left feeling insignificant and
alienated. This attitude has, for example, lead to a movement to eliminate
salutatorian and valedictorian recognition and speeches at graduation
ceremonies. Those in the movement claim that acknowledging salutatorian and
valedictorian students for their scholastic achievements causes other students
to feel slighted. This is a misguided assumption. Government gives everyone
equal opportunity to attend school and to excel. Some students work harder than
others and deserve special honors at graduation. Just like in a race, everyone
begins at the same starting line and therefore has the same chance to succeed.
Each person makes his own decision about how he will run the race. No one has
an excuse, then, for not trying his best to succeed.</p>

<p>Competition drives people to achieve a goal. For most, this
goal represents a person&rsquo;s best. Since everyone&rsquo;s concept
of "best" is different,
achievement differs for each person. Therefore, when an individual reaches his
goal, this gives him a certain status. This status is different for each
person, depending on the goal that was attained. This is extremely important
because if competition did not place people at different positions in life, the
resulting equality would be stultifying to society. For example, the work force
would consist of only custodians and no CEO&rsquo;s or vice versa.</p>

<p>CEO&rsquo;s get to where they are only through
competition. As an employee works hard and competes within a company, he is
rewarded for his accomplishments with promotions. Not only does competition
award people through tangible benefits like promotions, but competition also
gives long-lasting psychological awards such as a feeling of self-worth or
pride. This recognition encourages people who succeed to raise their personal
goals even higher. Recognition also drives those who were not recognized to do
better so that they too may be rewarded.</p>

<p>Because competition results in rewards, both tangible and
emotional, it is essential for a growing and thriving society. Everyone begins
at the same starting line and is given the same chance to succeed. When the
starting gun fires, it is up to each runner to decide how he will run the race.
This decision will ultimately determine who will become the winners. Driven by
competition, these winners, along with the losers, comprise a successful
society.</p>
