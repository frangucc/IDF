	<h1>Present Your Perspective on an Issue</h1></p>

<p>The <em>Present Your Perspective on an
Issue</em> section of the test asks you to do just that&mdash;present
your perspective on a given issue. In addition, you are required to provide
solid evidence to support your position. You will be given two essay prompts,
and you have 45 minutes to choose one of the prompts and then plan and write
your essay. Following is the grading scale for the Issue essay. Remember that
