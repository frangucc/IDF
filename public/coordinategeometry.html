	<h1>Coordinate Geometry</h1>

<p>On a number line, the numbers increase in size to the right
and decrease to the left:</p>

<p>If we draw a line through the point 0 perpendicular to the
number line, we will form a grid:</p>

<p><img width=289 height=269

<p>The thick horizontal line in the above diagram is called the
<em>x</em>-axis, and the thick vertical line is called the <em>y</em>-axis.
The point at which the axes meet, (0, 0), is called the origin. On the <em>x</em>-axis,
positive numbers are to the right of the origin and increase in size to the
right; further, negative numbers are to the left of the origin and decrease in
size to the left. On the <em>y</em>-axis, positive numbers are
above the origin and ascend in size; further, negative numbers are below the
origin and descend in size. As shown in the diagram, the point represented by
the ordered pair (<em>x, y</em>) is reached by moving <em>x</em>
units along the <em>x</em>-axis from the origin and then moving <em>y</em>
units vertically. In the ordered pair (<em>x, y</em>), <em>x</em>
is called the abscissa and <em>y</em> is
called the ordinate; collectively they are called
coordinates. The <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes divide
the plane into four quadrants, numbered I, II, III, and IV counterclockwise. Note,
if <em>x</em> &#8800; <em>y</em>, then <span class="equation">(<em>x,
y</em>) and (<em>y, x</em>)</span> represent different points on the
coordinate system. The points <span class="equation">(2, 3), (&ndash;3, 1), (&ndash;4, &ndash;4),
and (4, &ndash;2)</span> are plotted in the following coordinate system:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
 In the figure below, polygon <em>ABCO</em> is a square. If the coordinates of <em>B</em>
are (<em>h</em>,4), what is the value of <em>h </em>? </p>

class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
the <span class="equation"><span class="equation"><em>y</em>-coordinate</span></span> of point <em>B</em> is 4,
line segment <em>CO</em> has length 4. Since figure <em>ABCO</em>
is a square, line segment <em>AO</em> also has length 4. Since
point <em>B</em> is in the second quadrant, the <span class="equation"><span class="equation"><em>x</em>-coordinate</span></span>
of <em>B</em> is <span class="equation">&ndash;4</span>. <strong>The answer is (D)</strong>. Be careful not to
choose 4. <em>h</em> is the <span class="equation"><span class="equation"><em>x</em>-coordinate</span></span> of
point <em>B</em>, not the length of the square&rsquo;s side.</p>
