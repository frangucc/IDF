	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
the <em>"the first term in the sequence is
</em>&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span><em>"</em>
and <em>"all odd numbered terms are equal,"
</em>all odd numbered terms equal &radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span>. Since the <em>"the
second term is &ndash;2"</em> and <em>"all
even numbered terms are equal,"</em> all even
numbered terms equal &ndash;2. <br>Hence, the sum of any two consecutive terms
of the sequence is  <span class="equation">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(&minus;2)&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;&minus;0.6</span>&nbsp;(remember,
<span class="equation">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span>&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;1.4</span>). Further, the
product of any two consecutive terms of the sequence is <span class="equation">&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span>(&minus;2)&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;&minus;2.8</span>. Since <span class="equation">
&ndash;0.6</span> is greater
than &ndash;2.8, Column A is larger. <strong>The answer is
(A).</strong></p>
