<div class="passage">
<p>"A writer&rsquo;s job is to
tell the truth," said Hemingway in 1942. No other
writer of our time had so fiercely asserted, so pugnaciously defended or so
consistently exemplified the writer&rsquo;s obligation to speak truly. His
standard of truth-telling remained, moreover, so high and so rigorous that he
was ordinarily unwilling to admit secondary evidence, whether literary evidence
or evidence picked up from other sources than his own experience. "I
only know what I have seen," was a statement which
came often to his lips and pen. What he had personally done, or what he knew
unforgettably by having gone through one version of it, was what he was
interested in telling about. This is not to say that he refused to invent
freely. But he always made it a sacrosanct point to invent in terms of what he
actually knew from having been there.</p>

<p>The primary intent of his writing, from first to last, was
to seize and project for the reader what he often called "the
way it was." This is a characteristically simple phrase
for a concept of extraordinary complexity, and Hemingway&rsquo;s conception
of its meaning subtly changed several times in the course of his career&mdash;always
in the direction of greater complexity. At the core of the concept, however,
one can invariably discern the operation of three aesthetic instruments: the
sense of place, the sense of fact, and the sense of scene.</p>

<p>The first of these, obviously a strong passion with
Hemingway, is the sense of place. "Unless you have
geography, background," he once told George
Antheil, "you have nothing."
You have, that is to say, a dramatic vacuum. Few writers have been more
place-conscious. <span class="highlight">Few have so carefully charted out the geographical ground work
of their novels while managing to keep background so conspicuously unobtrusive.</span>
Few, accordingly, have been able to record more economically and graphically
the way it is when you walk through the streets of Paris in search of breakfast
at a corner caf&eacute; . . . Or when, at around six o&rsquo;clock of a Spanish
dawn, you watch the bulls running from the corrals at the Puerta Rochapea
through the streets of Pamplona towards the bullring.</p>

<p>"When I woke it was the sound of
the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals
at the edge of town. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies
were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all
running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the
bullring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers
who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the
bulls, galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight
around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the
bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together."</p>

<p>This landscape is as morning-fresh as a design in India ink
on clean white paper. First is the bare white street, seen from above, quiet
and empty. Then one sees the first packed clot of runners. Behind these are the
thinner ranks of those who move faster because they are closer to the bulls. Then
the almost comic stragglers, who are "really
running." Brilliantly behind these shines the "little
bare space," a desperate margin for error. Then the
clot of running bulls&mdash;closing the design, except of course for the
man in the gutter making himself, like the designer&rsquo;s initials, as
inconspicuous as possible.</p>From the author&rsquo;s comments and the
example of the bulls (paragraph 4), what was the most likely reason for which
Hemingway took care to include details of place?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>He
felt that geography in some way illuminated other, more important events. </p></li><li><p>He
thought readers generally did not have enough imagination to visualize the
scenes for themselves.</p></li><li><p>He had no other
recourse since he was avoiding the use of other literary sources.</p></li><li><p>He
thought that landscapes were more important than characters to convey "the
way it was."</p></li><li><p>He
felt that without background information the readers would be unable to follow
the story.</p></li></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is an extension question. In lines 28&ndash;30, Hemingway effectively
equates geography with background, and says that without them "you
have nothing." In lines highlighted in blue, the author
refers to the "geographical groundwork"
of Hemingway&rsquo;s novels. Both of these statements imply that details of
place set the stage for other, more important events. Hence <strong>the answer is (A).</strong> Don&rsquo;t
try to draw a distinction between "geography,"
"background," and "landscape."
The author uses them interchangeably when referring to details of place. Such
latitude with labels is often mimicked by the Question-Writers. </p>

<p>Choice (D) is a close second-best. The author indicates that
geography, background, and landscape are quite important to Hemingway. In fact,
"first" in the opening
to paragraph 3 almost indicates that details of place are the most important
aspect of his writing. Looking closely, however, we see that the passage gives
no indication of Hemingway&rsquo;s perspective on characters. So no
comparison can be made.</p>
