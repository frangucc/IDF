	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>In the past few years and to this day, many teachers of math and science <u>had chosen to return to the private
sector.</u></div><div class="options"><ol

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect because it uses the past perfect <em>had
chosen</em>, which describes an event that has been completed before
another event. But the sentence implies that teachers have and are continuing
to return to the private sector. <br>Hence, the present perfect tense should be
used.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is incorrect because it uses the present
progressive tense <em>having</em> <em>chosen</em>,
which describes an ongoing event. Although this is the case, it does not
capture the fact that the event began in the past.</p>

<p>Choice (C) is incorrect because it uses the simple past <em>chose</em>,
which describes a past event. But again, the sentence implies that the teachers
are continuing to opt for the private sector.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (D) is the correct
answer</strong> because it uses the present perfect <em>have</em>
<em>chosen</em> to describe an event that occurred in the past and
is continuing into the present.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is incorrect because it leaves the thought in the
sentence uncompleted.<strong></p>
