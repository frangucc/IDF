</div>
<div class="passage">Most students arrive at [college] using "discrete,
concrete, and absolute categories to understand people, knowledge, and values."
These students live with a <em>dualistic</em> view, seeing "the
world in polar terms of we-right-good vs. other-wrong-bad."
These students cannot acknowledge the existence of more than one point of view
toward any issue. There is one "right"
way. And because these absolutes are assumed by or imposed on the individual
from external authority, they cannot be personally substantiated or
authenticated by experience. These students are slaves to the generalizations
of their authorities. An eye for an eye! Capital punishment is apt justice for
murder. The Bible says so.</p>

<p>Most students break through the dualistic stage to another
equally frustrating stage&mdash;<em>multiplicity</em>. Within
this stage, students see a variety of ways to deal with any given topic or
problem. However, while these students accept multiple points of view, they are
unable to evaluate or justify them. To have an opinion is everyone&rsquo;s
right. While students in the dualistic stage are unable to produce evidence to
support what they consider to be self-evident absolutes, students in the
multiplistic stage are unable to connect instances into coherent
generalizations. Every assertion, every point, is valid. In their democracy
they are directionless. Capital punishment? What sense is there in answering
one murder with another?</p>

<p>The third stage of development finds students living in a
world of <em>relativism</em>. Knowledge is relative: right and
wrong depend on the context. No longer recognizing the validity of each
individual idea or action, relativists examine everything to find its place in
an overall framework. While the multiplist views the world as unconnected,
almost random, the relativist seeks always to place phenomena into coherent
larger patterns. Students in this stage view the world analytically. They
appreciate authority for its expertise, using it to defend their own
generalizations. In addition, they accept or reject ostensible authority <em>after
systematically</em> evaluating its validity. In this stage, however,
students resist decision making. Suffering the ambivalence of finding several
consistent and acceptable alternatives, they are almost overwhelmed by
diversity and need means for managing it. Capital punishment is appropriate
justice&mdash;in some instances.</p>

<p>In the final stage students manage diversity through individual
<em>commitment.</em> Students do not deny relativism. Rather they
assert an identity by forming commitments and assuming responsibility for them.
They gather personal experience into a coherent framework, abstract principles
to guide their actions, and use these principles to discipline and govern their
thoughts and actions. The individual has chosen to join a particular community
and agrees to live by its tenets. The accused has had the benefit of due
process to guard his civil rights, a jury of peers has found him guilty, and
the state has the right to end his life. This is a principle my community and I
endorse.</p>Which one of the following kinds of thinking
is NOT described in the passage?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>People
who assume that there is no right or wrong in any issue</p></li><li><p>People
who make unreasoned commitments and stick by them</p></li><li><p>People
who believe that right or wrong depends on the situation</p></li><li><p>People
who commit themselves to a particular point of view after having considered
several alternative concepts</p></li><li><p>People who
think that all behavior can be accounted for by cause and effect relationships</p></li></ol></div>
