</div>
<div class="passage">Imagine that we stand on any ordinary seaside
pier, and watch the waves rolling in and striking against the iron columns of
the pier. Large waves pay very little attention to the columns&mdash;they
divide right and left and re-unite after passing each column, much as a
regiment of soldiers would if a tree stood in their way; it is almost as though
the columns had not been there. But the short waves and ripples find the
columns of the pier a much more formidable obstacle. When the short waves
impinge on the columns, they are reflected back and spread as new ripples in
all directions. To use the technical term, they are "scattered."
The obstacle provided by the iron columns hardly affects the long waves at all,
but scatters the short ripples.</p>

<p>We have been watching a working model of the way in which
sunlight struggles through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Between us on
earth and outer space the atmosphere interposes innumerable obstacles in the
form of molecules of air, tiny droplets of water, and small particles of dust. They
are represented by the columns of the pier.</p>

<p>The waves of the sea represent the sunlight. We know that
sunlight is a blend of lights of many colors&mdash;as we can prove for
ourselves by passing it through a prism, or even through a jug of water, or as
Nature demonstrates to us when she passes it through the raindrops of a summer
shower and produces a rainbow. We also know that light consists of waves, and
that the different colors of light are produced by waves of different lengths,
red light by long waves and blue light by short waves. The mixture of waves
which constitutes sunlight has to struggle through the obstacles it meets in
the atmosphere, just as the mixture of waves at the seaside has to struggle
past the columns of the pier. And these obstacles treat the light waves much as
the columns of the pier treat the sea-waves. The long waves which constitute
red light are hardly affected, but the short waves which constitute blue light
are scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>Thus, the different constituents of sunlight are treated in
different ways as they struggle through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. A
wave of blue light may be scattered by a dust particle, and turned out of its
course. After a time a second dust particle again turns it out of its course,
and so on, until finally it enters our eyes by a path as zigzag as that of a
flash of lightning. Consequently, the blue waves of the sunlight enter our eyes
from all directions. And that is why the sky looks blue.</p>
A scientist makes new observations and learns
that water waves of shorter wavelengths spread in all directions not only
because they scatter off piers but also because they interact with previously
scattered short water waves. Drawing upon the analogy between water waves and
light waves, we might hypothesize which of the following?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Blue
light waves act like ripples that other blue light waves meet and scatter from.</p></li><li><p>Red
light waves will be scattered by blue light waves like incoming long water
waves are scattered by outgoing ripples.</p></li><li><p>Red
light waves can scatter blue light waves, but blue light waves cannot scatter
red.</p></li><li><p>The analogy between water and light
waves cannot be extended to include the way in which short water waves become
ripples and scatter one another.</p></li><li><p>The
scattering effect of blue light waves is canceled by that of red.</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is an application question since it introduces new information about water
waves and asks us to conclude how the behavior of light waves might be
similarly affected. Given this information, however, we can justify no
conclusion about whether light waves imitate water waves in this new regard. The
analogy might hold or it might break down. We don&rsquo;t yet know. (To
find out we would have to do an experiment using light.) <strong>The
answer is (D).</p>
