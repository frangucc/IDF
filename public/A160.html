	  <p><strong>Column A</strong><br>
The average of four positive numbers of which the greatest

<p><strong>Column B</strong><br>
The average of four positive numbers of which the greatest

	<li><p>Not enough information to decide.</p></li>

	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> There
is not enough information. For example, if the four numbers in Column A are 18,
19, 20, and 21, then their average is 19.5. Further, if the four numbers in
Column B are 8, 9, 10, and 11, then their average is 9.5. In this case, Column
A is larger. However, keeping the same four numbers for Column B and changing
the numbers in Column A to 1, 2, 3, and 21 gives an average of 6.75. In this
case, Column B is larger. <strong>The answer is (D).</strong></p>
