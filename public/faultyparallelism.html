	<h1>Faulty Parallelism</h1>
	<p>  For a sentence to be parallel, similar elements must be
expressed in similar form.</p>

<p>  When two adjectives modify the same noun,
they should have similar forms.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The topology course was both <em>rigorous</em>
and <em>a challenge</em>.</p>

<p>Since both <em>rigorous</em> and <em>a
challenge</em> are modifying <em>course</em>, they should
have the same form:</p>

<p>The topology course was both <em>rigorous</em>
and <em>challenging</em>.</p>

<p>  When a series of clauses is listed, the
verbs in each clause must have the same form.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  During his trip to Europe, the President will
<em>discuss</em> ways to stimulate trade, <em>offer</em>
economic aid, and <em>trying</em> to forge a new coalition with
moderate forces in Russia.</p>

<p>In this example, the first two verbs, <em>discuss</em>
and <em>offer</em>, are active. But the third verb in the series, <em>trying</em>,
is passive. The form of the verb should be active:</p>

<p>During his trip to Europe, the President will
<em>discuss</em> ways to stimulate trade, <em>offer</em>
economic aid, and <em>try</em> to forge a new coalition with
moderate forces in Russia.</p>

<p>  When the first half of a sentence has a
certain structure, the second half should preserve that structure.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><em><br>
  To acknowledge</em> that one
is an alcoholic is <em>taking</em> the first and hardest step to
recovery.</p>

<p>The first half of the above sentence has an
infinitive structure, <em>to acknowledge</em>, so the second half
must have a similar structure:</p>

<p><em>To acknowledge</em> that one
is an alcoholic is <em>to take</em> the first and hardest step to
recovery.</p>
