	<h1>Opposite Directions </h1> In this type of
problem, two people start at the same point and travel in opposite directions. The
key to these problems is that the total distance traveled is the sum of the
individual distances traveled.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong> <br>
Two people start
jogging at the same point and time but in opposite directions. If the rate of
one jogger is 2 mph faster than the other and after 3 hours they are 30 miles
apart, what is the rate of the faster jogger?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>3</p></li><li><p>4</p></li><li><p>5</p></li><li><p>6</p></li><li><p>7</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>r</em> be the rate of the slower jogger. Then the rate of the
faster jogger is <span class="equation"><em>r</em> + 2</span>. Since they are jogging for 3
hours, the distance traveled by the slower jogger is <span class="equation"><em>D</em> = <em>rt</em>
= 3<em>r</em></span>, and the distance traveled by the faster jogger is <span class="equation">3(<em>r</em>
+ 2)</span>. Since they are 30 miles apart, adding the distances traveled gives </p>

<p>3<em>r</em> + 3(<em>r</em> + 2) = 30</p>

<p>3<em>r</em> + 3<em>r</em> + 6 = 30</p>

<p>6<em>r</em> + 6 = 30</p>

<p>6<em>r</em> = 24</p>

<p><em>r</em> = 4</p>

<p>Hence, the rate of the faster jogger is <span class="equation"><em>r</em>
+ 2 = 4 + 2 = 6</span>. <strong>The answer is (D).</strong></p>
