	<h1>Patterns of Development</h1></p>

<p>Just as there is no universal answer to every question,
there are many ways to write a persuasive Issue essay. There are specific
strategies that you can use to more effectively respond to different types of
Issue topics. These strategies, or methods, are called patterns of development.
The type of pattern you choose to employ in writing your essay is dependent
upon the question or prompt to which you are responding. Usually, an essay
question will contain certain clues, which enable you to determine which
pattern of development to use. After choosing a method to use, you will find it
much easier to develop a clear, concise thesis, which, in turn, will affect the
way you organize your essay.</p>

<p>There are three main patterns of development. Let&rsquo;s
examine them now so we have a better understanding of how to apply them. For
each, we will discuss clues in an Issue question that prompt the use of a
particular pattern of development, we will look at an example of such a
question, and we will determine what your job as a writer will be in applying
this method.</p>

<p><u><strong>Comparison &ndash; Contrast</strong></u></p>

<p></strong>An Issue question that commands the
use of the Comparison &ndash; Contrast pattern of development:</p>

<p>&bull; will use words that suggest similarity or
difference. </p>

<p>&bull; will seek to persuade the reader that one
item is superior to another. </p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>"American cars
are better than foreign cars."</p>

<p>The author uses the word <em>than</em>
to compare the two cars, and he seeks to persuade the reader that an American
car is a wiser choice than a foreign one.</p>

<p>Your job: By employing the Comparison &ndash;
Contrast pattern of development, you will portray similarities and differences
between two items to prove which one is superior, either in agreement or
disagreement with the author&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p><u><strong>Cause &ndash; Effect</strong></u></p>

<p></strong>An Issue question that requires the
use of the Cause &ndash; Effect method of response:</p>

<p>&bull; may include an "If...then"
statement. </p>

<p>&bull; may lack an effect.</p>

<p>Example (if...then):<br>
"<u>If</u>
college and university faculty spent time outside the academic world working in
professions relevant to the courses they teach, <u>then</u> the
overall quality of higher education would greatly increase."</p>

<p>The author argues that if a certain action is
taken, a desirable effect is achieved. </p>

<p>Your job: In your essay, you must prove that
a particular cause results in a particular effect, either in agreement or
disagreement with the author.</p>

<p><strong>Example (lack of effect): </strong><br>
"More
restrictions should be set on teenage drivers."</p>

<p>In this "call for
action" statement, the author offers no effects
that will result if the action is taken, but surely it is implied that, if the
author feels the action should be taken, he assumes something positive will
result.</p>

<p>Your job: In your responsive essay, it would
be your responsibility to support your position in agreement with this
statement or against it, thus proving the implied effect.</p>

<p><strong><u>Definition</u></strong></p>

<p></strong>An Issue question that dictates the
use of the Definition pattern of development:</p>

<p>&bull; will attempt to show that, by definition,
a particular idea or concept is of great value.</p>

<p>&bull; may portray a very limited definition of
an idea or concept.</p>

<p><strong>Example (great value):</strong><br>
"Patriotism
breaks down the walls of division."</p>

<p>The author believes that a concept can do a
great thing.</p>

<p>Your job: Define the idea or concept and show
that, because of its attributes and qualities, it has value or it lacks value.</p>

<p><strong>Example (limited definition):</strong><br>
"A person&rsquo;s
generosity can be determined by examining what he or she has given to charity."</p>

<p>In this example, the author seeks to provide
a very limited definition of a particular concept.</p>

<p>Your job: Support the author&rsquo;s
definition with evidence, or show that the definition is much broader.</p>
