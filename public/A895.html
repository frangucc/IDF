relationship between INSINCERE and MISANTHROPE. A MISANTHROPE may or may not be
sincere. Eliminate (A). There is no relationship between BENEVOLENT and
EXCELLENCE. One who is benevolent may or may not be excellent at what he does. Eliminate
(B). There is no relationship between DISCERNING (having a perceiving mind) and
HOPE. Eliminate (D). There is no relationship between COMPOSED and INNOCENCE.
One who is innocent may or may not be composed. Eliminate (E). <br>Hence, by
process of elimination, <strong>the answer is (C).</strong></span></p>
