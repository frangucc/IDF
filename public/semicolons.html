	<h1>Semicolons</h1>
	<p>Use a semicolon</p>

<ol><li>(Rule 1) to join two independent
clauses.</p>

<p></li><li>(Rule 2) to join more than two
independent clauses.</p>

<p></li><li>(Rule 3) to separate items in a series.</p>

<p></li></ol><strong>Rule
1:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a semicolon to join two independent clauses
that are closely related. You may also use a semicolon in coordination with a
transitional word and in place of a comma and a conjunction.</p>

<p>Sometimes a period seems like too strong of a
mark to use to separate two closely related sentences, but a comma does not
emphasize both sentences adequately. In cases like this, you can use a
semicolon to join two independent clauses. Using a semicolon to join two
independent clauses gives you as the writer a subtle way of showing a
relationship between two clauses. You might use a semicolon, for example, if
your second sentence restates your first. Or perhaps your second sentence more
clearly defines your first sentence by giving an example or by presenting a
contrast. Finally, you may want to link two clauses with a semicolon if they
have a cause and effect relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>Loyalty is the foundation upon which
relationships are built; without loyalty, friendships and marriages crumble.</p>

<p>In this example, the second sentence restates
the first sentence. A semicolon is appropriate here and functions to convey the
close relationship between the two sentences.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  The puppy scooted blindly across the floor;
his eyes hadn&rsquo;t opened yet leaving him totally dependent on his
mother.</p>

<p>The second sentence in this example more
clearly defines why the puppy is moving around blindly. The semicolon ties the
explanation of the first clause to the description in the second clause. A
semicolon is also functional in this last example:</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s pouring down rain on
the day of the picnic; it was sunny the day we were inside roller-skating!</p>

<p>The semicolon here emphasizes the irony that
is portrayed in this sentence by connecting the two contrasting sentences.</p>

<p>Contrasting clauses may also be joined by
using a semicolon along with a transitional word.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>These days there is a cure for every ailment;
however, the side effects of many medications are worse than the condition for
which the medication is prescribed.</p>

<p>Here two independent clauses are joined with
a semicolon and the transitional word <em>however</em>. The second
clause shows that medicines don&rsquo;t always produce positive effects in
contrast with the first clause, which indicates that almost every ailment can
be cured. The transitional word <em>however</em> further defines
this contrasting relationship. A transitional word may also serve to emphasize
a cause-effect relationship such as in this example:</p>

<p>The drought has greatly affected many
farmers; therefore, the price of produce is expected to rise.</p>

<p>You may choose to use semicolons to portray a
close relationship between two clauses as seen in the examples above. In other
cases, you may recognize that using a variety of punctuation marks adds interest
to your writing. Based on this recognition, the choice to join two clauses with
a semicolon and a transitional word may be a stylistic choice rather than a
grammatical one. Likewise, adding variety to your writing may be the purpose
when it comes to replacing a comma and conjunction with a semicolon.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br>
</strong>The slippery rock presented the climbers with
a challenge, <u>so</u> they watched their footing very closely.</p>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<p>The slippery rock presented the climbers with a challenge;
they watched their footing very closely.</p>

<p>In the first example, the two independent
clauses are joined with a comma and a conjunction, and in the second sentence,
a semicolon replaces the comma and the conjunction. While both sentences are
correct and function equally well, you may choose to use the semicolon this way
to add variety. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to replace the comma with a
semicolon in order to provide clarity. In these cases, you may or may not omit
the conjunction. For example,</p>

<p>From such a great distance, the man could not
make out the faces of the evil, crafty conspirators, but, if he moved any
closer, he would be taking an unnecessary, careless risk of being seen.</p>

<p>Because this sentence contains so much
punctuation, it is a bit tedious to read and can be confusing. To remedy this,
a semicolon can be used to join the two clauses. In this case, the conjunction <em>but</em>
is important in enhancing the cause and effect relationship in the sentence and
therefore it should remain:</p>

<p>From such a great distance, the man could not
make out the faces of the evil, crafty conspirators; but, if he moved any
closer, he would be taking an unnecessary, careless risk of being seen.</p>

<p>The semicolon in the example above provides
much needed clarity to the sentence by separating the two independent clauses.</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>To use a semicolon to join two independent
clauses, analyze the two clauses carefully to make sure there is a close
relationship between the two before placing the semicolon. Be careful not to
misuse semicolons, especially when you use them with a transitional word or in
place of a comma and conjunction. For example:</p>

<p>Incorrect:</p>

<p>I was forced; therefore, to take the detour
around the construction site.</p>

<p>Correct:</p>

<p>I was forced, therefore, to take the detour
around the construction site.</p>

<p>In this example, <em>therefore
</em>is a transitional word and should be set off with commas.
Furthermore, the clause <em>I was forced</em> is an independent
clause and <em>to take the detour around the construction site</em>
is not, so the clauses cannot be set apart by a semicolon. </p>

<p>Take the same caution when replacing a comma
and conjunction with a semicolon. Remember that, to join two clauses with a
comma and a conjunction, both clauses must be independent. That is, each clause
must be able to stand alone as a separate sentence. For example,</p>

<p>Incorrect:</p>

<p>He completed the yard work, and then enjoyed
a lemonade break with his mom.</p>

<p>Incorrect:</p>

<p>He completed the yard work; and then enjoyed
a lemonade break with his mom.</p>

<p>Correct:</p>

<p>He completed the yard work and then enjoyed a
lemonade break with his mom.</p>

<p>The subject in this sentence is <em>He</em>
and the compound verb is <em>completed</em> and <em>enjoyed</em>.
There is no subject in the second part of the sentence, so it is incorrect to
use a comma and conjunction in the sentence. Likewise, a semicolon cannot be
used.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a semicolon to join more than
two independent clauses.</p>

<p>In Rule 1, we discussed using a semicolon to
join two independent clauses. Semicolons can also be used to join multiple
independent clauses in more complex sentences:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Over the past few years, violence has adopted
a new calling card; it is more random, gruesome and sinister than ever. In this
country of freedom, violence has made its presence known in all areas of life.
In schools, students take the lives of other students before taking their own;
a close knit community is gripped by fear because of random shootings by a sniper;
a father kills another father over their sons&rsquo; hockey game.</p>

<p>This example could be written as a few
separate sentences; however, since the independent clauses are all closely
related, it is acceptable to link them with semicolons. Joining multiple
independent clauses is often a stylistic choice and an effective one because it
makes an impact by more closely connecting the sentences. When not serving just
a stylistic choice, joining more than two independent clauses with a semicolon
adds clarity such as in the following example:</p>

<p>Confusing:</p>

<p>The Thompsons spent two exciting weeks on
safari in Africa and returned with wild tales of their trip. They saw all the
sights anyone who goes on safari dreams of: They saw zebras, rhinoceroses, and
giraffes grazing on the savanna, they witnessed a lion chasing after an
antelope, a herd of elephants stomped across the road in front of their truck,
and some curious, chattering monkeys came up to their truck and took food out
of their hands.</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<p>The Thompsons spent two exciting weeks on
safari in Africa and returned with wild tales of their trip. They saw all the
sights anyone who goes on safari dreams of: They saw zebras, rhinoceroses, and
giraffes grazing on the savanna; they witnessed a lion chasing after an
antelope; a herd of elephants stomped across the road in front of their truck;
and some curious, chattering monkeys came up to their truck and took food out
of their hands.</p>

<p>In the first example, the writer uses commas
to separate the series of clauses. However, because the clauses themselves
contain lists of words separated by commas, the sentence is confusing; the
semicolons in the second example provide clarity by dividing the clauses.</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>To join multiple independent
clauses with a semicolon, make sure the clauses you are joining are related.
Also consider using a semicolon instead of a comma to join clauses. To do this,
check for commas within the clauses. Too many commas cause confusion and can be
eliminated by using semicolons instead. Be careful, however, not to use
semicolons too often because overuse can make a writer sound pedantic. When
used conservatively, semicolons can add a great deal of impact. To avoid
overusing semicolons, reread your text and make sure your use of semicolons is
sporadic; semicolons should never appear as often as commas or periods.</p>

<p>Too many semicolons:</p>

<p>My next interviewee came in and sat across
from me; she tried to put on a confident face; she maintained eye contact
throughout the interview; I could tell she was nervous, though; she played
anxiously with her ring; she shifted positions every few seconds; her voice
quivered a bit.</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<p>My next interviewee came in and sat across
from me. She tried to put on a confident face by maintaining eye contact
throughout the interview. I could tell she was nervous, though; she played
anxiously with her ring, shifted positions every few seconds and her voice
quivered a bit.</p>

<p>Semicolons are used in place of periods and
almost all of the commas in the first example. In the rewrite of the example,
all but one semicolon is replaced with a period. The remaining semicolon is
placed after <em>I could tell she was nervous, though</em>. The
clause that follows gives a description that further defines the assumption
that the interviewee was nervous.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 3:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Use a semicolon to separate items
in a series when the items themselves contain commas.</p>

<p>Just as you should use semicolons to join
independent clauses when the clauses contain commas, you should also use
semicolons to separate words and phrases in a series when those words and
phrases contain commas. For example,</p>

<p>Confusing:</p>

<p>I boarded a flight in Los Angeles,
California, had a two-hour layover in Detroit, Michigan, and finally landed in
London, England.</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<p>I boarded a flight in Los Angeles,
California; had a two-hour layover in Detroit, Michigan; and finally landed in
London, England.</p>

<p>This sentence contains a series of clauses,
which must be separated. However, each clause contains the name of a city and a
state, which also must be separated. Using only commas in this example causes
confusion because it is difficult to tell which commas separate clauses and
which ones separate the elements within each clause. Separating the clauses
with semicolons clarifies the meaning. Here is another example:</p>

<p>All employees must bring a pen, paper, and a
notebook to the first day of training; a laptop, highlighter and paperclips to
day two; and a sample report, pie chart and three markers to the last day.</p>

<p>Here again, too many commas creates
confusion, so in order to simplify the sentence and make it more clear, the
clauses in the series are separated by semicolons.</p>

<p><u>Check your work</u></p>

<p>Check each of the independent clauses you have
joined with commas. Do any of the independent clauses contain commas? If so,
joining the independent clauses with a semicolon instead of a comma will
probably make the sentence clearer.</p>

<p>Confusing:</p>

<p>My pottery class is on Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, and I baby sit my nephew, niece, and neighbor&rsquo;s son on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<p>My pottery class is on Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays; and I baby sit my nephew, niece and neighbor&rsquo;s son on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

<p>Again, be careful not to overuse semicolons.
If, after you review your writing, you feel you have used semicolons too often,
consider using other methods to join phrases. For example, you might use a
period to divide clauses into separate sentences. Remember that semicolons can
make a big impact but only when used conservatively and correctly.</p>
