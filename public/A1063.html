class="solution">Solution:</span>Printing
something that is untrue would reflect negatively on the editor, so he
hesitated to print the articles because they were "improbable."
<strong>The answer is (C).</strong> "Indecisive"
could also be the reason the editor hesitated to print the articles, but "improbable"
is a stronger reason not to publish an article. One of the jobs of an editor is
to verify the truth of an article. Publishing false material could subject the
editor to ridicule or even legal action.</p>
