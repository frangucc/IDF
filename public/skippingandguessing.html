	<h1>Skipping and Guessing</h1>

<p>On the test, you cannot skip questions; each question must
be answered before moving to the next question. However, if you can eliminate
even one of the answer-choices, guessing can be advantageous. We&rsquo;ll
talk more about this later. Unfortunately, you cannot return to previously
answered questions.</p>

<p>On the test, your first question will be of medium
difficulty. If you answer it correctly, the next question will be a little
harder. If you again answer it correctly, the next question will be harder
still, and so on. If your GRE skills are strong and you are not making any
mistakes, you should reach the medium-hard or hard problems by about the fifth
problem. Although this is not very precise, it can be quite helpful. Once you
have passed the fifth question, you should be alert to subtleties in any
seemingly simple problems.</p>

<p>Often students become obsessed with a particular problem and
waste time trying to solve it. To get a top score, learn to cut your losses and
move on. The exception to this rule is the first five questions of each
section. Because of the importance of the first five questions to your score,
you should read and solve these questions slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>If you are running out of time, randomly guess on the
remaining questions. This is unlikely to harm your score. In fact, if you do
not obsess about particular questions (except for the first five), you probably
will have plenty of time to solve a sufficient number of questions.</p>

<p>Because the total number of questions answered contributes
to the calculation of your score, you should answer ALL the questions&mdash;even
if this means guessing randomly before time runs out.</p>
