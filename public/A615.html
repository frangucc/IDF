</div>
<div class="passage">
<p>In the United States the per capita costs of schooling have
risen almost as fast as the cost of medical treatment. But increased treatment
by both doctors and teachers has shown steadily declining results. Medical
expenses concentrated on those above forty-five have doubled several times over
a period of forty years with a resulting 3 percent increase in the life
expectancy of men. The increase in educational expenditures has produced even
stranger results; otherwise President Nixon could not have been moved this
spring to promise that every child shall soon have the "Right
to Read" before leaving school.</p>

<p>In the United States it would take eighty billion dollars
per year to provide what educators regard as equal treatment for all in grammar
and high school. This is well over twice the $36 billion now being spent. Independent
cost projections prepared at HEW and at the University of Florida indicate that
by 1974 the comparable figures will be $107 billion as against the $45 billion
now projected, and these figures wholly omit the enormous costs of what is
called "higher education,"
for which demand is growing even faster. The United States, which spent nearly
eighty billion dollars in 1969 for "defense,"
including its deployment in Vietnam, is obviously too poor to provide equal
schooling. The President&rsquo;s committee for the study of school finance
should ask not how to support or how to trim such increasing costs, but how
they can be avoided.</p>

<p>Equal obligatory schooling must be recognized as at least
economically unfeasible. In Latin America the amount of public money spent on
each graduate student is between 350 and 1,500 times the amount spent on the
median citizen (that is, the citizen who holds the middle ground between the
poorest and the richest). <span class="highlight">In the United States the discrepancy is smaller, but
the discrimination is keener. </span>The richest parents, some 10 percent, can afford
private education for their children and help them to benefit from foundation
grants. But in addition they obtain ten times the per capita amount of public
funds if this is compared with the per capita expenditure made on the children
of the 10 percent who are poorest. The principal reasons for this are that rich
children stay longer in school, that a year in a university is
disproportionately more expensive than a year in high school, and that most
private universities depend&mdash;at least indirectly&mdash;on
tax-derived finances.</p>

<p>Obligatory schooling inevitably polarizes a society; it also
grades the nations of the world according to an international caste system. Countries
are rated like castes whose educational dignity is determined by the average
years of schooling of its citizens, a rating which is closely related to per
capita gross national product, and much more painful.</p><p>By stating "In
Latin America the amount of public money spent on each graduate student is
between 350 and 1,500 times the amount spent on the median citizen"
and "In the United States the discrepancy is
smaller" the author implies that </div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>equal
education is possible in the United States but not in Latin America.</p></li><li><p> equal education for all at the graduate level is an
unrealistic ideal.</p></li><li><p> educational spending is more efficient in the United
States. </p></li><li><p> higher education is more expensive than lower education
both in Latin America and in the United States, but more so in Latin America.</p></li><li><p> underfunding of lower education is a world-wide problem.</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is another extension question. By stating that the amount of funding spent on
graduate students is more than 350 times the amount spent on the average citizen,
the author implies that it would be impossible to equalize the funding. Hence <strong>the
answer is (B). </strong></p>

<p>None of the other choices have any real merit. (A) is
incorrect because the import of the passage is that the rich get better
schooling and more public funds in the United States and therefore
discrimination is "keener"
here (lines highlighted in blue).</p>

<p>(C) and (D) are incorrect because they are neither mentioned
nor implied by the passage.</p>

<p>(E) is the second-best choice. Although this is implied by
the numbers given, it has little to do with the primary purpose of the passage&mdash;to
show that obligatory education is perhaps not such a good idea.</p>
