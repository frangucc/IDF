  <p><strong>Column A</strong><br>The number of integers between 29 and 69, inclusive</p>

<p><strong>Column B</strong><br>The number of integers between 31 and 70, inclusive</p>

	<li><p>Not enough information to decide.</p></li></ol>

	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
the number of integers between two integers inclusive is one more than their
difference, Column A has 69 &ndash; 29 + 1 = 41 integers and Column B has
70 &ndash; 31 + 1 = 40 integers. <br>Hence, Column A is larger, and <strong>the
answer is (A).</strong></p>
