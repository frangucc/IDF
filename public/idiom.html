<p><em>(Correct)</em> I <em>doubt
that</em> his new business will succeed.</p>

<p>He threw the discs <em>farther</em> (distance)
than the top seated competitor.</p>

expected.</p>

<p>This bid is <em>identical
with</em> the one submitted by you.</p>

<p>In contrast to (not <em>of</em>)</p>

of</em> the other branches of government.</p>

<p>Not only...but also</p>

cannot be replaced with <em>and</em>.</p>

<p><em>(Faulty)</em> Peterson is <em>not
only</em> the top salesman in the department <em>and also</em>
the most proficient.</p>

<p><em>(Correct)</em> Peterson is <em>not
only</em> the top salesman in the department <em>but
also</em> the most proficient.</p>

<p><strong>On account of vs. Because</strong></p>

<p><em>Because</em> is always better
than the circumlocution <em>on account of</em>.</p>

<p><em>(Poor)</em> <em>On account
of</em> his poor behavior, he was expelled.</p>

<p><em>(Better)</em> <em>Because</em>
he behaved poorly, he was expelled.</p>

<p>One another/Each other</p>

<p><em>Each other</em> should be
used when referring to two things, and <em>one another</em> should
be used when referring to more than two things.</p>

two) congratulated <em>one another</em> on their victory.</p>

other</em> on their successful first year.</p>

<p><strong>Plus vs. And</strong></p>

<p>Do not use <em>plus</em> as a
conjunction meaning <em>and</em>.</p>

<p><em>(Faulty)</em> His
contributions to this community are considerable, <em>plus</em> his
character is beyond reproach.</p>

<p><em>(Correct)</em> His contributions to this
community are considerable, <em>and</em> his character is beyond
reproach.</p>

<p>Note: <em>Plus</em> can be used
to mean <em>and</em> so long as it is not being used as a
conjunction.</p>

<p><em>(Acceptable)</em> His
generous financial contribution <em>plus</em> his donated time has
made this project a success.</p>

<p>In this sentence, <em>plus</em>
is being used as a preposition. Note that the verb <em>has</em> is
singular because an intervening prepositional phrase (<em>plus</em>
his donated time) does not affect subject verb agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Regard vs. Regards</strong></p>

<p>Unless you are giving best wishes to someone,
you should use <em>regard</em>.</p>

<p><em>(Faulty)</em> In <em>regards</em>
to your letter, we would be interested in distributing your product.</p>

<p><em>(Correct)</em> In <em>regard</em>
to your letter, we would be interested in distributing your product.</p>

<p><strong>Regardless vs. Irregardless</strong></p>

<p><em>Regardless</em> means "not
withstanding." Hence, the "ir"
in <em>irregardless</em> is redundant. <em>Regardless</em>
is the correct form.</p>

<p>Retroactive to (not <em>from</em>)</p>

<p>The correct idiom is <em>retroactive
to</em>:</p>

<p>The tax increase is <em>retroactive
to</em> February.</p>

<p>Speak to/with</p>

<p>To <em>speak to</em> someone is
to tell them something:</p>

<p>We <em>spoke to</em> Jennings about the alleged
embezzlement.</p>

<p>To <em>speak with</em> someone is
to discuss something with them:</p>

<p>Steve <em>spoke with</em> his friend Dave for
hours yesterday.</p>

<p>The reason is because</p>

<p>This structure is redundant. Equally common
and doubly redundant is the structure <em>the reason why is
because</em>.</p>

<p><em>(Poor) </em>The <em>reason
why</em> I could not attend the party <em>is because</em> I
had to work.</p>

<p><em>(Better)</em> I could not
attend the party <em>because</em> I had to work.</p>

<p>Whether vs. As to whether</p>

<p>The circumlocution <em>as to
whether</em> should be replaced by <em>whether</em>.</p>

<p><em>(Poor)</em> The United
Nations has not decided <em>as to whether </em>to authorize a trade
embargo.</p>

<p><em>(Better)</em> The United Nations has not
decided <em>whether</em> to authorize a trade embargo.</p>

<p>Whether vs. If</p>

<p><em>Whether</em> introduces a
choice; <em>if</em> introduces a condition. A common mistake is to
use <em>if</em> to present a choice.</p>

<p><em>(Faulty)</em> He inquired <em>if</em>
we had decided to keep the gift.</p>

<p><em>(Correct)</em> He inquired <em>whether</em>
we had decided to keep the gift.</p>
