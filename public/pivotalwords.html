	<h1>Pivotal Words</h1>


<p>As mentioned before, each passage contains
300 to 600 words and only a few questions, so you will <u>not</u>
be tested on most of the material in the passage. Your best reading strategy,
therefore, is to identify the places from which questions will most likely be
drawn and concentrate your attention there.</p>

<p>Pivotal words can help in this regard. Following are the
most common pivotal words.</p>

<p><u><strong>PIVOTAL WORDS</strong></u></p>

<p>But</p>

<p>Although</p>

<p>However</p>

<p>Yet</p>

<p>Despite</p>

<p>Nevertheless</p>

<p>Nonetheless</p>

<p>Except</p>

<p>In contrast</p>

<p>Even though</p>


<p>As you may have noticed, these words indicate contrast. Pivotal
words warn that the author is about to either make a U-turn or introduce a
counter-premise (concession to a minor point that weakens the argument).</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>(Counter-premise)</p>

<p>I submit that the strikers should accept the management&rsquo;s
offer. Admittedly, it is less than what was demanded. But it does resolve the
main grievance&mdash;inadequate health care. Furthermore, an independent
study shows that a wage increase greater than 5% would leave the company unable
to compete against Japan and Germany, forcing it into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The conclusion, "the strikers
should accept the management&rsquo;s offer," is
stated in the first sentence. Then "Admittedly"
introduces a concession (counter-premise); namely, that the offer was less than
what was demanded. This weakens the speaker&rsquo;s case, but it addresses
a potential criticism of his position before it can be made. The last two
sentences of the argument present more compelling reasons to accept the offer
and form the gist of the argument. </p>

<p>Pivotal words mark natural places for questions to be drawn.
At a pivotal word, the author changes direction. The GRE writers form questions
at these junctures to test whether you turned with the author or you continued
to go straight. Rarely do the GRE writers let a pivotal word pass without
drawing a question from its sentence.</p>


<p>As you read a passage, note the pivotal words and refer to
them when answering the questions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s apply this theory to the
passage on criminal justice. For easy reference, the passage is reprinted here
in the left-hand column, with explanations in the right-hand column. The
pivotal words are marked in bold.</p>



<p>There are two major systems of criminal
procedure in the modern world&mdash;the adversarial and the inquisitorial. The
former is associated with common law tradition and the latter with civil law
tradition. Both systems were historically preceded by the system of private
vengeance in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
administered it privately, either personally or through an agent. The vengeance
system was a system of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
slogan "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
The modern adversarial system is only one historical step removed from the
private vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic features.
Thus, for example, <strong>even though</strong> the right to
institute criminal action has now been extended to all members of society and <strong>even
though</strong> the police department has taken over the pretrial
investigative functions on behalf of the prosecution, the adversarial system
still leaves the defendant to conduct his own pretrial investigation. The trial
is still viewed as a duel between two adversaries, refereed by a judge who, at
the beginning of the trial has no knowledge of the investigative background of
the case. In the final analysis the adversarial system of criminal procedure
symbolizes and regularizes the punitive combat.</p>

<p><strong>By contrast</strong>, the inquisitorial
system begins historically where the adversarial system stopped its
development. It is two historical steps removed from the system of private
vengeance. Therefore, from the standpoint of legal anthropology, it is historically
superior to the adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the public
investigator has the duty to investigate not just on behalf of the prosecutor <strong>but
also</strong> on behalf of the defendant. Additionally, the public
prosecutor has the duty to present to the court not only evidence that may lead
to the conviction of the defendant <strong>but also</strong>
evidence that may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that both
parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence in their possession. Finally,
in an effort to make the trial less like a duel between two adversaries, the
inquisitorial system mandates that the judge take an active part in the conduct
of the trial, with a role that is both directive and protective.</p>

<p>Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial system. This
system operates on the philosophical premise that in a criminal case the
crucial factor is not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the
goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the court the
commission of the alleged crime.</p>


<p><strong>Even though</strong>&mdash;Here "even
though" is introducing a concession. In the
previous sentence, the author stated that the adversarial system is only one step
removed from the private vengeance system. The author uses the two concessions
as a hedge against potential criticism that he did not consider that the
adversarial system has extended the right to institute criminal action to all
members of society and that police departments now perform the pretrial
investigation. But the author then states that the adversarial system still
leaves the defendant to conduct his own pretrial investigation. This marks a
good place from which to draw a question. Many people will misinterpret the two
concessions as evidence that the adversarial system is two steps removed from
the private vengeance system.</p>

<p><strong>By contrast</strong>&mdash;In this
case the pivotal word is not introducing a concession. Instead it indicates a change
in thought: now the author is going to discuss the other criminal justice
system. This is a natural place to test whether the student has made the
transition and whether he will attribute the properties soon to be introduced
to the inquisitorial system, not the adversarial system.</p>

<p><strong>But also</strong>&mdash;In both
places, "but also"
indicates neither concession nor change in thought. Instead it is part of the
coordinating conjunction "not only . . . but also .
. . ." Rather than indicating contrast, it
emphasizes the second element of the pair.</p>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see how these pivotal words
can help answer the questions in the last section. The first is from the
Description Section:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
According to the passage, the inquisitorial system differs
from the adversarial system in that </div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>it
does not make the defendant solely responsible for gathering evidence for his
case</p></li><li><p>it does not require the police
department to work on behalf of the prosecution</p></li><li><p>it
does not allow the victim the satisfaction of private vengeance </p></li><li><p>it
requires the prosecution to drop a weak case</p></li><li><p>a
defendant who is innocent would prefer to be tried under the inquisitorial
system </p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
pivotal phrase "by contrast"
flags the second paragraph as the place to begin looking. The pivotal phrase "but
also" introduces the answer&mdash;namely that
the prosecutor must also investigate "on behalf of
the defendant." <strong>The answer is
(A)</strong>.</p>

<p>The next question is from the Writing Techniques Section:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Which one of the following best describes the
organization of the passage?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Two
systems of criminal justice are compared and contrasted, and one is deemed to
be better than the other.</p></li><li><p>One system of
criminal justice is presented as better than another. Then evidence is presented
to support that claim. </p></li><li><p>Two systems of
criminal justice are analyzed, and one specific example is examined in detail.</p></li><li><p>A
set of examples is presented. Then a conclusion is drawn from them. </p></li><li><p>The
inner workings of the criminal justice system are illustrated by using two
systems.</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
pivotal phrase "by contrast"
gives this question away. The author is comparing and contrasting two criminal
justice systems, which the opening pivotal word introduces. Hence <strong>the
answer is (A)</strong>.</p>


<p>For our final example, consider the question from the
Extension Section:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
The author views the prosecution&rsquo;s role in the
inquisitorial system as being</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>an
advocate for both society and the defendant</p></li><li><p>solely
responsible for starting a trial</p></li><li><p>a
protector of the legal rule</p></li><li><p>an
investigator only</p></li><li><p>an aggressive but fair
investigator</p>

</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
information needed to answer this question is introduced by the pivotal phrase,
"but also." There it is
stated that the prosecutor must present evidence that may exonerate the
defendant; that is, he must act fairly. <strong>The answer is
(E)</strong>.<strong></p>
