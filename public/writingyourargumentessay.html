	<h1>Writing Your Argument Essay</h1>
	<p>Now that you are familiar with techniques for analyzing an
argument, it is time to discuss techniques that will help you write an
effective critique. You will have only 30 minutes to complete this portion of
the test and, luckily, there are only 5 steps you need to take. As with the <em>Present
Your Perspective on an Issue</em> section, we will create some formulas
to simplify the task. Plugging information into these formulas will help you
organize your ideas and prepare you for your critique.</p>



<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &ndash; Understanding the Argument</p>

<p>Remember that your goal in the
Argument section is to analyze the given argument. You cannot effectively
analyze the argument until you completely understand it. To understand the
argument, first read it and then answer the following questions. Keep in mind
that you have a short amount of time, so spend more time mulling over the
questions than jotting down notes. If you do write notes, make sure they are
just short words and phrases that will help you formulate a plan, not long
notations that will take time to write and then review.</p>

<ul><li> Identify the conclusion.</li>
<li> What premises does the author offer to support
the conclusion?</li>
<li> <span style="text-indent:5px;">What fallacies or flaws do you recognize
in the argument?</span></li>
<li>What assumptions are made in the argument?</li>
<li>What does the argument fail to address?</li>
<li>What necessary evidence is omitted from
the argument?</li></ul>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> &ndash; Developing Your
Thesis</p>

<p>Your thesis statement will set up your entire
essay by letting the reader know what direction your critique will take. It
will also provide you with a blueprint by which you can organize your essay.</p>

<p>ANALYZE AN ARGUMENT THESIS <em>(formula
1)</em>:</p>

<p>The argument that_______________
creates several problems because</p>

<p>1) it assumes that ___________, <br>
  2)
it fails to address__________, <br>
  3) it omits the
following important evidence: __________________.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> &ndash; Organizing Your
Thoughts</p>

<p>Once you have formulated a thesis, it is time
to organize the information that you will present in your essay. This is now a
simple task since you have already developed a thesis. You only need to plug in
the correct information in the formula below. (Note that the following formula
requires you to plug in the three numbered items from your thesis in
succession. Although it is not necessary to discuss them in this order, we will
label it that way for simplicity.) In addition, there are spaces in the formula
for you to insert 1 or 2 pieces of supporting evidence.</p>

<p>ANALYZING AN ARGUMENT ESSAY FORMULA <em>(formula
2)</em>:</p>

<p>I. Introduction</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Restate topic</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Thesis <em>(formula 1)</em></p>

<p>II. The argument assumes that...(thesis point #1)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Support</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Support</p>

<p>III. The argument never addresses...(thesis point #2)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Support</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Support</p>

<p>IV. The argument omits important evidence...(thesis point
#3)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Support</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Support</p>

<p>V. Conclusion</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Restate thesis</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Offer solution to strengthen argument</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> &ndash; Writing Your Essay</p>

<p>Writing your essay should not be difficult now that you have
organized your points and the support for each point. Paying close attention to
the general tips you learned earlier and the more specific techniques in this
section, start writing. Following your essay formula, make sure you include
transitional words and phrases, which will enhance the flow of your critique.
You should spend about 20 minutes writing, reserving about 5 minutes at the end
for proofreading and revising.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> &ndash; Revising Your Essay</p>

<p>You should spend about 5 minutes proofreading
and revising your essay. Look for misspellings and grammatical errors while
keeping in mind the following questions:</p>

<ul><li> Is my introduction
captivating?</li>
<li> Does my thesis clearly tell the reader
what my essay will be about?</li>
<li> Have I thoroughly, yet concisely, proven
my points?</li>
<li> Do my body paragraphs support my thesis?</li>
<li> Have I used logical transitions that help
the text flow smoothly between sentences and between paragraphs?</li>
<li> Have I maintained a formal tone and
diction throughout my essay?</li>
<li> Have I maintained consistent use of person
(i.e., first, second, third)?</li>
<li> Is there a word, or are there words, which
I have used too often in the essay?</li>
<li> Do my sentences vary in length and
structure?</li></ul>

<p>If time is still remaining after you have
made any necessary changes, go back and revise your essay again. You may catch
more errors the second time around.</p>
