</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect. Recall that intervening phrases have no effect on
subject-verb agreement. In this sentence, the subject <em>ownership</em>
is singular, but the verb <em>are</em> is plural. Dropping the
intervening phrase clearly shows that the sentence is ungrammatical:<strong></p>

<p></strong><em>In a co-publication, agreement
ownership are equally shared by the parties.<strong></p>

<p></strong></em>Choice (B) is incorrect. Neither
adding <em>each of</em> nor interchanging <em>shared</em>
and <em>equally</em> addresses the issue of subject-verb agreement.</p>

<p>Choice (D) contains a faulty pronoun reference. The
antecedent of the plural pronoun <em>their</em> would be the
singular noun <em>material</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is incorrect since it still contains the plural
verb <em>are</em>. <strong>The answer is choice (C).</p>
