  <p><strong>Column A</strong><br>The number of even integers between 0 and 100</p>

<p><strong>Column B</strong><br>The number of multiples of 3 between 0 and 100</p>

	<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Multiples
of 3 occur once in every three consecutive integers <span class="equation">
(1, 2, <strong>3</strong>,
4, 5, <strong>6</strong>, 7, 8, <strong>9</strong>, . .
.)</span>. Even numbers occur once in every two consecutive integers <span class="equation">
(1, <strong>2</strong>,
3, <strong>4</strong>, 5, <strong>6</strong>, 7, <strong>8</strong>,
9, . . .)</span>. <br>Hence, the frequency of occurrence of even numbers is greater than
the frequency of occurrence of multiples of 3. Since the range&mdash;0 to
100&mdash;is the same in each column, Column A contains more numbers. <strong>The
answer is (A).</strong></p>
