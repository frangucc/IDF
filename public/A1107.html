	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>Unless you maintain at least a

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect. In this context, <em>graduate</em> requires the
word <em>from</em>:  you will not <em>graduate
from</em> medical school."</p>

<p>The use of the passive voice in choices (B) and (C) weakens
the sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (D) is the answer</strong> since
it uses the correct idiom <em>graduate from</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (E) changes the meaning of the sentence and does not
correct the faulty idiom.<strong></p>
