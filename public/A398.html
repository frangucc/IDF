a system of equations has at least as many equations as variables, it is
unlikely to have a unique solution. Since we have three variables&mdash;<em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>&mdash;and only two
equations, there probably is not a unique solution to this system. If <em>x</em>
= 9, <em>y</em> = 0, and <span class="equation"><em>z</em> = 1</span>, then both
equations are satisfied and Column A is larger. However, if <span class="equation"><em>x</em>
= 9,</span> <span class="equation"><em>y</em> = 10</span>, and <em>z</em> = &ndash;9,
then both equations are satisfied and Column B is larger. This is a double case
and therefore <strong>the answer is (D).</strong></p>
