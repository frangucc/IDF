<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> The figure shows that the circle is
located between the lines <em>y</em> = 4 and <em>y</em>
= &ndash;4 and that the circle is symmetric to <em>x</em>-axis.
From this, we make two observations: </p>

<p>1) The center of the circle is on the <em>x</em>-axis.
</p>

<p>2) The diameter of the circle is 8.</p>

<p>Since the center of the circle is on the <em>x</em>-axis,
the points (2, 0) and (<em>x</em>, 0) must be diametrically
opposite points of the circle. That is, they are end points of a diameter of
the circle. <br>Hence, the distance between the two points, <span class="equation"><em>x</em> &ndash;
2,</span> must equal the length of the diameter. <br>Hence, <span class="equation"><em>x</em> &ndash;
2 = 8</span>. Adding 2 to both sides of this equation, we get <em>x</em> =
10. <strong>The answer is D</strong>.</p>
