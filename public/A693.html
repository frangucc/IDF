class="solution">Solution:</span>The
prefix "sub" gives
SUBTERFUGE the sense of going down. So we expect SUBTERFUGE to have a negative
connotation. <br>Hence, we are looking for a positive word. Now, "bewilderment"
is somewhat negative&mdash;eliminate. "Artlessness"
(sincere, ingenuous) is positive; it may be the answer. "Deceit"
is negative&mdash;eliminate. "Felicitation"
(an expression of good wishes, congratulation) is also positive; it too may be
the answer. "Jeopardy"
is negative&mdash;eliminate. Now, SUBTERFUGE means "deceit,
conspiracy." The opposite is artlessness. <strong>The
answer is (B).</strong></p>
