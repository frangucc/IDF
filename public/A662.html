</div>
<div class="passage">Imagine that we stand on any ordinary seaside
pier, and watch the waves rolling in and striking against the iron columns of
the pier. Large waves pay very little attention to the columns&mdash;they
divide right and left and re-unite after passing each column, much as a
regiment of soldiers would if a tree stood in their way; it is almost as though
the columns had not been there. But the short waves and ripples find the
columns of the pier a much more formidable obstacle. When the short waves
impinge on the columns, they are reflected back and spread as new ripples in
all directions. To use the technical term, they are "scattered."
The obstacle provided by the iron columns hardly affects the long waves at all,
but scatters the short ripples.</p>

<p>We have been watching a working model of the way in which
sunlight struggles through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Between us on
earth and outer space the atmosphere interposes innumerable obstacles in the
form of molecules of air, tiny droplets of water, and small particles of dust. They
are represented by the columns of the pier.</p>

<p>The waves of the sea represent the sunlight. We know that
sunlight is a blend of lights of many colors&mdash;as we can prove for
ourselves by passing it through a prism, or even through a jug of water, or as
Nature demonstrates to us when she passes it through the raindrops of a summer
shower and produces a rainbow. We also know that light consists of waves, and
that the different colors of light are produced by waves of different lengths,
red light by long waves and blue light by short waves. The mixture of waves
which constitutes sunlight has to struggle through the obstacles it meets in
the atmosphere, just as the mixture of waves at the seaside has to struggle
past the columns of the pier. And these obstacles treat the light waves much as
the columns of the pier treat the sea-waves. The long waves which constitute
red light are hardly affected, but the short waves which constitute blue light
are scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>Thus, the different constituents of sunlight are treated in
different ways as they struggle through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. A
wave of blue light may be scattered by a dust particle, and turned out of its
course. After a time a second dust particle again turns it out of its course,
and so on, until finally it enters our eyes by a path as zigzag as that of a
flash of lightning. Consequently, the blue waves of the sunlight enter our eyes
from all directions. And that is why the sky looks blue.</p>
We all know that when there is a clear sky,
the western sky appears red as the sun sets. From the information presented in
the passage, this phenomenon would seem to be explained by which of the
following?</p>

<p>I. Light meets more obstacles when passing parallel to the
earth&rsquo;s surface than when traveling perpendicular. Consequently, even
red light is diffused.</p>

<p>II. The blue light may not make it through the denser
pathway of the evening sky, leaving only the long light waves of red.</p>

<p>III. The short red light waves have more energy and are the
only waves that can make it through the thick atmosphere of the evening sky.</div><div

class="solution">Solution:</span>Statement
I is true. There are obviously more particles on a horizontal than a vertical
path. The glowing red sky is reasonable evidence for some diffusion. Note that
Question 24 asks "what can we <em>conclude</em>"
while this question asks what seems <em>plausible</em> (what "would
seem to be explained"). So, while we are attempting
to make very similar inferences in both questions, what we can do with the data
depends, among other things, on the degree of certainty requested. Statement II
is true. The path of evening light probably has a greater average density,
since it spends more time passing through a zone of thicker atmosphere. It is
reasonable to assume this significantly greater density, or the absolute number
of particles, might present an obstacle to blue light. Statement III is false. There
are two things wrong with this answer: (1) red light waves are not short,
relative to blue; (2) we do not know that waves with more energy will more
readily pass through obstacles. The passage, in fact, implies just the
opposite. <strong>The answer is (C).</p>
