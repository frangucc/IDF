	<h1>Premises</h1>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found the conclusion, most often
everything else in the argument will be either premises or "noise."
The premises provide evidence for the conclusion; they form the foundation or
infrastructure upon which the conclusion depends. To determine whether a statement
is a premise, ask yourself whether it supports the conclusion. If so, it&rsquo;s
a premise. Earlier we saw that writers use certain words to flag conclusions;
likewise writers use certain words to flag premises. Following is a partial
list of the most common premise indicators:</p>

<p>Premise indicators are very helpful. As with conclusion
indicators, though, you must use them cautiously because they have other
functions. For example, <em>since</em> can indicate a premise, or
it can merely indicate time.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><u><br>
  Since</u> the incumbent&rsquo;s views are
out of step with public opinion, he probably will not be reelected.</p>

<p>Here <em>since</em> is used to
flag the premise that the incumbent&rsquo;s positions are unpopular.
Contrast this use of <em>since</em> with the following example.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><u><br>
  Since</u> the incumbent was elected to
office, he has spent less and less time with his family.</p>

<p>In this case, <em>since</em>
merely expresses a passage of time. The statement as a whole expresses an
observation, rather than an argument.</p>

<p><strong><u>Suppressed Premises</u></strong></p>

<p>Most arguments depend on one or
more unstated premises. Sometimes this indicates a weakness in the argument, an
oversight by the writer. More often, however, certain premises are left tacit
because they are too numerous, or the writer assumes that his audience is aware
of the assumptions, or he wants the audience to fill in the premise themselves
and therefore be more likely to believe the conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Conclusion: I knew he did it.</p>

<p>Premise: Only a guilty person would accept immunity from
prosecution.</p>

<p>The suppressed premise is that he did, in
fact, accept immunity. The speaker assumes that his audience is aware of this
fact or at least is willing to believe it, so to state it would be redundant
and ponderous. If the unstated premise were false (that is, he did not accept
immunity), the argument would not technically be a lie; but it would be very
deceptive. The unscrupulous writer may use this ploy if he thinks that he can
get away with it. That is, his argument has the intended effect and the false
premise, though implicit, is hard to find or is ambiguous. Politicians are not
at all above using this tactic.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Politician: A hawk should not be elected President because
this country has seen too many wars.</p>

<p>The argument has two tacit premises&mdash;one
obvious, the other subtle. Clearly, the politician has labeled his opponent a
hawk, and he hopes the audience will accept that label. Furthermore, although
he does not state it explicitly, the argument rests on the assumption that a
hawk is likely to start a war. He hopes the audience will fill in that premise,
thereby tainting his opponent as a warmonger.</p>

<p>When attacking an argument, we often
challenge its suppressed premises. Finding the suppressed premise, or
assumption, of an argument can be difficult. To test whether something is a
suppressed premise, ask yourself whether it would make the argument more
plausible. If so, then it is very likely a suppressed premise.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  American attitudes tend to be rather insular, but there is
much we can learn from other countries. In Japan, for example, workers set
aside some time each day to exercise, and many corporations provide elaborate
exercise facilities for their employees. Few American corporations have such
exercise programs. Studies have shown that the Japanese worker is more
productive than the American worker. Thus it must be concluded that the
productivity of American workers will lag behind their Japanese counterparts,
until mandatory exercise programs are introduced.</p>

<p>The unstated essence of the argument is that
exercise is an integral part of productivity and that Japanese workers are more
productive than American workers because they exercise more.</p>

<p><strong>Example (Suppressed <u>false</u> premise):</strong><br>
The petrochemical industry claims that
chemical waste dumps pose no threat to people living near them. If this is
true, then why do they locate the plants in sparsely populated regions? By not
locating the chemical dumps in densely populated areas the petrochemical
industry tacitly admits that these chemicals are potentially dangerous to the
people living nearby.</p>

<p>The suppressed <em>false</em>
premise of the argument is that, all things being equal, there is no reason to
prefer locating the sites in sparsely populated areas. To weaken the argument,
we need to show it is <u>not</u> true that all things are equal. In
other words, there are advantages other than safety in locating the sites in
sparsely populated areas, such as cost and ease.</p>

<p><strong>Example (Suppressed <u>true</u> premise):</strong><br>
The news media is often accused of being
willing to do anything for ratings. However, recent action by a television
network indicates that the news media is sometimes guided by moral principle.
This network discovered through polling voters on the east coast that the
Republican candidate for President had garnered enough votes to ensure victory
before the polls closed on the west coast. However, the network withheld this
information until the polls on the west coast closed so that the information
would not affect the outcome of key congressional races.</p>

<p>The suppressed premise in this argument is
that the network expected its ratings to increase if it predicted the winner of
the presidential race, and to decrease if did not predict the winner.</p>
