	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q. </span>In the following sentence, part or all of the sentence is underlined. The answer-choices offer five ways of phrasing the underlined part. If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p><u>Jurassic Park, written by
Michael Crichton, and which was first printed in 1988</u>, is a novel about a theme

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect since the verb <em>written</em> is not parallel to
the construction <em>which was   printed</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (B) is the correct
answer</strong> since the sentence is concise and the verb <em>written</em>
is parallel to the verb <em>printed</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (C) does offer a parallel structure (<em>which
was written/which was printed</em>); however, choice (B) is more concise.</p>

<p>Choice (D) rambles. The introduction <em>Written by  
1988</em> is too long.</p>

<p>Choice (E) also offers a parallel structure (<em>which
was written/[which was] printed</em>); however, choice (B) again is more
concise. Note that <em>which was</em> need not be repeated for the
sentence to be parallel.<strong></p>
