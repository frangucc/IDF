In the game of chess, the Knight can make any
of the moves displayed in the diagram to the right. If a Knight is the only
piece on the board, what is the greatest number of spaces from which not all 8
moves are possible?<p><img width=215 height=215 src="qimage388.gif"></p></div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>8</p></li><li><p>24</p></li><li><p>38</p></li><li><p>48</p></li><li><p>56</p>



</ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> Since we are looking for the <u>greatest</u>
number of spaces from which not all 8 moves are possible, we can eliminate the
greatest number, 56. Now, clearly not all 8 moves are possible from the outer
squares, and there are 28 outer squares not 32. Also, not all 8 moves are
possible from the next to outer squares, and there are 20 of them not 24. All 8
moves are possible from the remaining squares. <br>Hence, the answer is <span class="equation">28 + 20 =
48</span>. <strong>The answer is D</strong>. Notice that 56, <span class="equation">(32 + 24)</span>, is
given as an answer-choice to catch those who don&rsquo;t add carefully.</p>
