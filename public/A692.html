class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
DEIGN starts with DE, it should be negative. So we are looking for a positive
word. "Inveigh" is
negative; it means to rail against. Eliminate (A). "Gainsay"
is also negative; it means "to contradict, to
impugn." Eliminate (B). "Speculate"
is neutral as is "reject,"
rejecting something may be wise or unwise depending on the circumstance&mdash;eliminate
(C) and (D). <br>Hence, by process of elimination, <strong>the answer is
(E).</strong> DEIGN means "to condescend, to
disdain." And LAUD means "to
praise, to extol."</p>
