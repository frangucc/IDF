	<div id="question"><span class="question">Q.&nbsp;</span>After reading the following passage, choose the best answer to the question.  Answer on the basis of what is <u>stated</u> or <u>implied</u> in that passage.
</div>
<div class="passage">Imagine that we stand on any ordinary seaside
pier, and watch the waves rolling in and striking against the iron columns of
the pier. Large waves pay very little attention to the columns&mdash;they
divide right and left and re-unite after passing each column, much as a
regiment of soldiers would if a tree stood in their way; it is almost as though
the columns had not been there. But the short waves and ripples find the
columns of the pier a much more formidable obstacle. When the short waves
impinge on the columns, they are reflected back and spread as new ripples in
all directions. To use the technical term, they are "scattered."
The obstacle provided by the iron columns hardly affects the long waves at all,
but scatters the short ripples.</p>

<p>We have been watching a working model of the way in which
sunlight struggles through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Between us on
earth and outer space the atmosphere interposes innumerable obstacles in the
form of molecules of air, tiny droplets of water, and small particles of dust. They
are represented by the columns of the pier.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">The waves of the sea represent the sunlight. We know that
sunlight is a blend of lights of many colors&mdash;as we can prove for
ourselves by passing it through a prism, or even through a jug of water, or as
Nature demonstrates to us when she passes it through the raindrops of a summer
shower and produces a rainbow.</span> We also know that light consists of waves, and
that the different colors of light are produced by waves of different lengths,
red light by long waves and blue light by short waves. The mixture of waves
which constitutes sunlight has to struggle through the obstacles it meets in
the atmosphere, just as the mixture of waves at the seaside has to struggle
past the columns of the pier. And these obstacles treat the light waves much as
the columns of the pier treat the sea-waves. The long waves which constitute
red light are hardly affected, but the short waves which constitute blue light
are scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>Thus, the different constituents of sunlight are treated in
different ways as they struggle through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. A
wave of blue light may be scattered by a dust particle, and turned out of its
course. After a time a second dust particle again turns it out of its course,
and so on, until finally it enters our eyes by a path <span class="highlighta">as zigzag as that of a
flash of lightning. Consequently, the blue waves of the sunlight enter our eyes
from all directions. And that is why the sky looks blue.</span></p>
Which one of the following is a reason for
assuming that sunlight is constituted of waves of many colors?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>The
mixture of waves that make up sunlight has to struggle through a variety of
obstacles in the atmosphere.</p></li><li><p>When
passing through water in the atmosphere, sunlight is sometimes broken down into
an array of colors.</p></li><li><p>Many different
wavelengths of light enter our eyes from all directions.</p></li><li><p>The
mere fact that light waves can be scattered is a reason for assuming that
sunlight is constituted of waves of different colors.</p></li><li><p>When
passing through dust in the atmosphere, sunlight is sometimes broken down into
an array of colors.</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>(A):
No. We do not know anything about a "variety"
of obstacles; even if we did, we would have no<strong> </strong>reason
to assume that<strong> </strong>light is constituted of different
colors. </p>

<p><strong>(B): Yes.</strong> See lines highlighted in blue.
Rainbows occur because light is constituted of many colors. (C): No. This is a
distortion of lines highlighted in green, and it sounds illogical to boot. </p>

<p>(D): No. This gives no reason to assume that light is
constituted of many colors. </p>

<p>(E): No. Water vapor in the atmosphere causes rainbows, not
dust.</p>
