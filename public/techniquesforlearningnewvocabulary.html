	<h1>TECHNIQUES FOR LEARNING NEW VOCABULARY</h1></p>

<p><strong>Put The Definition In Your Own Words</strong></p>

<p>The first technique for learning new words is to put the
definition in your own words. It is best to try to condense the definition to
only one or two words; this will make it easier to remember. You will find
simple one or two word definitions provided for you in the list of 4000
essential words in this app. You may be even more likely to remember these,
however, if you put the definitions in your own words. For example, take the
word</p>

<p><strong>Heinous</strong></p>

<p>The definition of <em>heinous</em> is "abominable,
vile." However, you may find it much easier to
remember by the word</p>

<p><strong>Horrible</strong></p>

<p>Often the dictionary definition of a word can be simplified
by condensing the definition into one word. Take, for example, the word</p>

<p><strong>Expiate</strong></p>

<p>The dictionary definition is "to
put an end to; to extinguish guilt, to make amends for."
This definition may be summed up by one word</p>

<p><strong>Atone</strong></p>

<p>Putting definitions in your own words makes them more
familiar and therefore easier to remember.</p>

<p><strong>Write Down The Words</strong></p>

<p>Many people are visual learners and do not fully benefit
from a mere review of words and their definitions as they appear in a
dictionary or in the list in this app. For these learners, writing the words
and their definitions may well make a dramatic difference in retaining the
words and their meanings. For many, it may take several times of writing the
word down along with its definition to make it all "sink
in." If you think this method is best for you, get
a notebook to write your words in.</p>

<p><strong>Use Flashcards</strong></p>

<p>If you decide to write down the new words you are learning,
you might also consider accomplishing two jobs at once by creating your own set
of flashcards. Cut heavyweight paper into a size that you feel is manageable.
Then, when you are practicing your words by writing them down, simply write the
words on one side of a flashcard and write the definition on the other side. You
will then have a wonderful tool with which to learn words on your own or to use
with a partner in quizzing each other.</p>

<p><strong>Create A Word Picture</strong></p>

<p>Creating mental word pictures is another visual technique
that you can apply to many words. You may remember in grade school learning the
difference between the word <em>principal</em> and the word <em>principle</em>.
Your teacher probably told you that <em>principal</em> refers to "the
leader of an educational institution" and the word
ends with "pal." Your
school principal wants to be your "pal,"
so this is easy to remember (after all, you always wanted to be best friends
with your principal, right?). Your teacher gave you a mental word picture.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take another word: <em>sovereign</em>.
<em>Sovereign</em> means "monarch."
The word itself contains the word <em>reign</em>. What do you think
of when you think of <em>reign</em>? You probably think of a king&mdash;or
a monarch. So, picture a king when you are trying to recall the meaning of <em>sovereign</em>,
and it should be easy to remember.</p>

<p>How about <em>pestilence</em>. <em>Pestilence</em>
means "disease." The
word <em>pest</em> is in the word. Pests are common in a garden,
and, unfortunately, they often cause diseases among the plants in a garden. So
when you see this word, picture a garden and then picture all of the pests that
bring diseases to your garden. Then you will remember the meaning of <em>pestilence</em>.</p>

<p>If you have created flashcards, it may help to draw a small
reminder on the flashcard of your mental word picture to further ingrain the
word in your memory. For example, for <em>sovereign</em>, you might
draw a small crown; for <em>pestilence</em>, you could pencil in a
pesty bug.</p>

<p>Creating mental word pictures helps you retain the meanings
of new words and clarifies your thinking when you get to the test.</p>

<p><strong>Set Goals</strong></p>

<p>Whatever technique works best for you, it is necessary to
set goals if you plan to learn the "Ubiquitous 400"
as well as the top 4000 words that are listed in this study guide. To do so,
first look ahead to your intended test date. Next, determine how many days you
have before this test date. Finally, divide the list so you have a preset goal
each day of how many words you will learn. This makes the task much less
formidable because you will be able to measure your accomplishments each day
rather than trying to attack in one sitting what seems to be an insurmountable
task.</p>
