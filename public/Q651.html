<div class="passage">
<p>"A writer&rsquo;s job is to
tell the truth," said Hemingway in 1942. No other
writer of our time had so fiercely asserted, so pugnaciously defended or so
consistently exemplified the writer&rsquo;s obligation to speak truly. His
standard of truth-telling remained, moreover, so high and so rigorous that he
was ordinarily unwilling to admit secondary evidence, whether literary evidence
or evidence picked up from other sources than his own experience. <span class="highlighta">"I
only know what I have seen,"</span> was a statement which
came often to his lips and pen. What he had personally done, or what he knew
unforgettably by having gone through one version of it, was what he was
interested in telling about. This is not to say that he refused to invent
freely. But he always made it a sacrosanct point to invent in terms of what he
actually knew from having been there.</p>

<p>The primary intent of his writing, from first to last, was
to seize and project for the reader what he often called "the
way it was." This is a characteristically simple phrase
for a concept of extraordinary complexity, and Hemingway&rsquo;s conception
of its meaning subtly changed several times in the course of his career&mdash;always
in the direction of greater complexity. At the core of the concept, however,
one can invariably discern the operation of three aesthetic instruments: the
sense of place, the sense of fact, and the sense of scene.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">The first of these, obviously a strong passion with
Hemingway, is the sense of place. "Unless you have
geography, background," he once told George
Antheil, "you have nothing."
You have, that is to say, a dramatic vacuum.</span> Few writers have been more
place-conscious. Few have so carefully charted out the geographical ground work
of their novels while managing to keep background so conspicuously unobtrusive.
Few, accordingly, have been able to record more economically and graphically
the way it is when you walk through the streets of Paris in search of breakfast
at a corner caf&eacute; . . . Or when, at around six o&rsquo;clock of a Spanish
dawn, you watch the bulls running from the corrals at the Puerta Rochapea
through the streets of Pamplona towards the bullring.</p>

<p>"When I woke it was the sound of
the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals
at the edge of town. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies
were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all
running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the
bullring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers
who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the
bulls, galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight
around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the
bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together."</p>

<p>This landscape is as morning-fresh as a design in India ink
on clean white paper. First is the bare white street, seen from above, quiet
and empty. Then one sees the first packed clot of runners. Behind these are the
thinner ranks of those who move faster because they are closer to the bulls. Then
the almost comic stragglers, who are "really
running." Brilliantly behind these shines the "little
bare space," a desperate margin for error. Then the
clot of running bulls&mdash;closing the design, except of course for the
man in the gutter making himself, like the designer&rsquo;s initials, as
inconspicuous as possible.</p>

<p>According to the author, Hemingway&rsquo;s primary
purpose in telling a story was</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>to
construct a well-told story that the reader would thoroughly enjoy.</p></li><li><p>to
construct a story that would reflect truths that were not particular to a
specific historical period.</p></li><li><p>to begin
from reality but to allow his imagination to roam from "the
way it was" to "the way
it might have been."</p></li><li><p>to
report faithfully reality as Hemingway had experienced it.</p></li><li><p>to
go beyond the truth, to "create"
reality.</p></li></ol></div>
