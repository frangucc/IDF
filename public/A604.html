</div>
<div class="passage">
<p>From Romania to Germany, from Tallinn to Belgrade, a major
historical process&mdash;the death of communism&mdash;is taking place. The
German Democratic Republic no longer exists as a separate state. And the former
German Democratic Republic will serve as the first measure of the price a
post-Communist society has to pay for entering the normal European orbit. In
Yugoslavia we will see whether the federation can survive without communism.</p>

<p>One thing seems common to all these countries: dictatorship
has been defeated and freedom has won, yet the victory of freedom has not yet
meant the triumph of democracy. Democracy is something more than freedom. Democracy
is freedom institutionalized, freedom submitted to the limits of the law,
freedom functioning as an object of compromise between the major political
forces on the scene.</p>

<p>We have freedom, but we still have not achieved the
democratic order. That is why this freedom is so fragile. In the years of
democratic opposition to communism, we supposed that the easiest thing would be
to introduce changes in the economy. <span class="highlight">In fact, we thought that the march from a
planned economy to a market economy would take place within the framework of
the bureaucratic system, and that the market within the Communist state would
explode the totalitarian structures.</span> Only then would the time come to build the
institutions of a civil society; and only at the end, with the completion of
the market economy and the civil society, would the time of great political
transformations finally arrive.</p>

<p>The opposite happened. First came the big political change,
the great shock, which either broke the monopoly and the principle of Communist
Party rule or simply pushed the Communists out of power. Then came the creation
of civil society, whose institutions were created in great pain, and which had
trouble negotiating the empty space of freedom. Only then, as the third moment
of change, the final task was undertaken: that of transforming the totalitarian
economy into a normal economy where different forms of ownership and different
economic actors will live one next to the other.</p>

<p>Today we are in a typical moment of transition. No one can
say where we are headed. The people of the democratic opposition have the
feeling that we won. We taste the sweetness of our victory the same way the
Communists, only yesterday our prison guards, taste the bitterness of their
defeat. Yet, even as we are conscious of our victory, we feel that we are, in a
strange way, losing. In Bulgaria the Communists have won the parliamentary
elections and will govern the country, without losing their social legitimacy. In
Romania the National Salvation Front, largely dominated by people from the old
Communist bureaucracy, has won. In other countries democratic institutions seem
shaky, and the political horizon is cloudy. The masquerade goes on: dozens of
groups and parties are created, each announces similar slogans, each accuses
its adversaries of all possible sins, and each declares itself representative
of the national interest. Personal disputes are more important than disputes
over values. Arguments over values are fiercer than arguments over ideas.</p><p>The author originally thought that the order
of events in the transformation of communist society would be represented by
which one of the following?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>A
great political shock would break the totalitarian monopoly, leaving in its
wake a civil society whose task would be to change the state-controlled market
into a free economy.</p></li><li><p>The transformation
of the economy would destroy totalitarianism, after which a new and different
social and political structure would be born.</p></li><li><p>First
the people would freely elect political representatives who would transform the
economy, which would then undermine the totalitarian structure.</p></li><li><p>The
change to a democratic state would necessarily undermine totalitarianism, after
which a new economic order would be created. </p></li><li><p>The
people&rsquo;s frustration would build until it spontaneously generated
violent revolution, which would sentence society to years of anarchy and
regression.</p></li></ol></div>
<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
is a description question, so you should locate the point in the passage from
which it was drawn. It is the third paragraph. In lines highlighted in blue, the
author recalls his expectation that, by introducing the market system, the
communist system would topple from within.</p>

<p>Be careful not to choose (A). It chronicles how the events
actually occurred, not how they were <em>anticipated</em> to occur.
(A) is baited with the words "great shock,"
"monopoly," and "civil
society."
<br><strong>The answer is (B).</strong></p>
