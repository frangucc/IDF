	<h1>Logical Fallacies</h1></p>

<p>Now that we have examined the components of logic that make
up an argument, let&rsquo;s define some logical fallacies. Fallacies in an
argument are elements of faulty reasoning that weaken the argument and may even
make it invalid.</p>

<p><strong><u>Contradiction</u></strong></p>

<p>Contradiction is the most glaring
type of fallacy. It is committed when two opposing statements are
simultaneously asserted. For example, saying "it is
raining <em>and</em> it is not raining"
is a contradiction. Typically, however, the writer obscures the contradiction
to the point that the argument can be quite compelling. Take, for instance, the
following argument:</p>

<p>"We cannot know anything,
because we intuitively realize that our thoughts are unreliable."</p>

<p>This argument has an air of reasonableness to it. But <em>intuitively</em>
<em>realize</em> means "to know."
Thus the writer is in essence saying that we <em>know</em> that we
don&rsquo;t know anything. This is self-contradictory.</p>

<p><strong><u>Equivocation</u></strong></p>

<p>Equivocation is the use of a word
in more than one sense during an argument. This technique is often used by
politicians to leave themselves an "out."
If someone objects to a particular statement, the politician can simply claim
the other meaning.</p>

<p>Individual rights must be championed by the
government. It is right for one to believe in God. So government should promote
the belief in God.</p>

<p>In this argument, <em>right</em>
is used ambiguously. In the first sentence, it is used in the sense of a
privilege, whereas in the second sentence <em>right</em> is used to
mean proper or moral. The questionable conclusion is possible only if the
arguer is allowed to play with the meaning of the critical word <em>right</em>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Circular Reasoning</u></strong></p>

<p>Circular reasoning involves
assuming as a premise that which you are trying to prove. Intuitively, it may
seem that no one would fall for such an argument. However, the conclusion may
appear to state something additional, or the argument may be so long that the
reader may forget that the conclusion was stated as a premise.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br></strong>The death penalty is appropriate for traitors because it is
right to execute those who betray their own country and thereby risk the lives
of millions.</p>

<p>This argument is circular because "right"
means essentially the same thing as "appropriate."
In effect, the writer is saying that the death penalty is appropriate because
it is appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br></strong>Democracy is the best form of government yet created.
Therefore, we must be vigilant in its defense; that is, we must be prepared to
defend the right to freedom. Because this right is fundamental to any progressive
form of government, it is clear that democracy is better than any other form of
government.</p>

<p>This argument is circular. It is incumbent on
the writer to give evidence or support for the conclusion. In this argument,
though, the writer first states that democracy is the best government, the rest
is merely "noise,"
until he restates the conclusion.</p>

<p><strong><u>Shifting the Burden of Proof</u></strong></p>

<p>It is incumbent on the writer to
provide evidence or support for her position. To imply that a position is true
merely because no one has disproved it is to shift the burden of proof to
others.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br></strong>Since no one has been able to prove God&rsquo;s
existence, there must not be a God.</p>

<p>There are two major weaknesses in this
argument. First, the fact that God&rsquo;s existence has yet to be proven
does not preclude any future proof of existence. Second, if there is a God, one
would expect that his existence is independent of any proof by man.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br></strong>Astronomers have created a mathematical model for
determining whether life exists outside our solar system. It is based on the
assumption that life as we know it can exist only on a planet such as our own,
and that our sun, which has nine planets circling it, is the kind of star
commonly found throughout the universe. Hence it is projected that there are
billions of planets with conditions similar to our own. So astronomers have
concluded that it is highly probable, if not virtually certain, that life
exists outside our solar system. Yet there has never been discovered so much as
one planet beyond our solar system. Hence life exists only on planet Earth.</p>

<p>This argument implies that since no planet
has been discovered outside our solar system, none exist and therefore no life
exists elsewhere in the universe. Hence the burden of proof is shifted from the
arguer to the astronomers.</p>

<p>Reasoning by shifting the burden of proof is
not always fallacious. In fact, our legal system is predicated on this method
of thought. The defendant is <em>assumed</em> innocent until proven
guilty. This assumption shifts the onus of proof to the state. Science can also
validly use this method of thought to better understand the world&mdash;so
long as it is not used to claim "truth."
Consider the following argument: "The multitude of
theories about our world have failed to codify and predict its behavior as well
as Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity. Therefore, our world is probably &rsquo;Einsteinian.&rsquo;"
This argument is strong so long as it is qualified with <em>probably</em>&mdash;otherwise
it is fallacious: someone may yet create a better theory of our world.</p>

<p><strong><u>Unwarranted Assumptions</u></strong></p>

<p>The <em>fallacy of
unwarranted assumption</em> is committed when the conclusion of an
argument is based on a premise (implicit or explicit) that is false or
unwarranted. An assumption is unwarranted when it is false&mdash;these
premises are usually suppressed or vaguely written. An assumption is also
unwarranted when it is true but does not apply in the given context&mdash;these
premises are usually explicit. The varieties of unwarranted assumptions are too
numerous to classify, but a few examples should give you the basic idea.</p>

<p><strong>Example <em>(False
Dichotomy)</em>:</strong></strong><br>
Either restrictions must be placed on freedom of speech or
certain subversive elements in society will use it to destroy this country.
Since to allow the latter to occur is unconscionable, we must restrict freedom
of speech.</p>

<p>The writer offers two options: either
restrict freedom of speech, or lose the country. He hopes the reader will
assume that these are the only options available. This is unwarranted. He does
not state how the so-called "subversive elements"
would destroy the country, nor for that matter, why they would want to destroy
it. There may be a third option that the author did not mention; namely, that
society may be able to tolerate the "subversives"
and it may even be improved by the diversity of opinion they offer.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br></strong>To score in the ninetieth percentile on the GRE, one must
study hard. If one studies four hours a day for one month, she will score in
the ninetieth percentile. Hence, if a person scored in the top ten percent on
the GRE, then she must have studied at least four hours a day for one month.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that this argument uses
the converse of the fallacy <em>"Confusing
Necessary Conditions with Sufficient Conditions"
</em>mentioned earlier. In other words, it assumes that something which
is sufficient is also necessary. In the given argument, this is fallacious
because some people may still score in the ninetieth percentile, though they
studied less than four hours a day for one month.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br></strong>Of course Steve supports government sponsorship of the arts.
He&rsquo;s an artist.</p>

<p>This argument is fallacious&mdash;and
unfair&mdash;because it assumes that all artists support government
sponsorship of the arts. Some artists, however, may have reasons for not
supporting government sponsorship of the arts. For example, they may believe
that government involvement stifles artistic expression. Or they may reject
government involvement on purely philosophical grounds. The argument suggests a
person&rsquo;s profession taints his opinion.</p>

<p><strong><u>Appeal to Authority</u></strong></p>

<p>To appeal to authority is to cite
an expert&rsquo;s opinion as support for one&rsquo;s own opinion. This
method of thought is not necessarily fallacious. Clearly, the reasonableness of
the argument depends on the "expertise"
of the person being cited and whether she is an expert in a field relevant to
the argument. Appealing to a doctor&rsquo;s authority on a medical issue,
for example, would be reasonable; but if the issue is about dermatology and the
doctor is an orthopedist, then the argument would be questionable.</p>

<p>The legalization of drugs is advocated by no
less respectable people than William F. Buckley and federal judge Edmund J.
Reinholt. These people would not propose a social policy that is likely to be
harmful. So there is little risk in experimenting with a one-year legalization
of drugs.</p>

<p>The only evidence that the author gives to
support her position is that respected people agree with her. She is appealing
to the authority of others.</p>

<p><strong><u>Personal Attack</u></strong></p>

<p>In a personal attack (ad hominem),
a person&rsquo;s character is challenged instead of her opinions, thereby
deflecting attention away from a solid argument.</p>

<p>Politician: How can we trust my opponent to
be true to the voters? He isn&rsquo;t true to his wife!</p>

<p>This argument is weak because it attacks the
opponent&rsquo;s character, not his positions. Some people may consider
fidelity a prerequisite for public office. History, however, shows no correlation
between fidelity and great political leadership.</p>

<p>A reporter responded with the following to
the charge that he resorted to tabloid journalism when he rummaged through and
reported on the contents of garbage taken from the home of Henry Kissinger.</p>

<p>"Of all the
printed commentary . . . only a few editorial writers thought to express the
obvious point that when it comes to invasion of privacy, the man who as
National Security Advisor helped to bug the home phones of his own staff
members is one of our nation&rsquo;s leading practitioners."&mdash;Washington
Monthly, October 1975</p>

<p>The reporter justifies his actions by
claiming that Kissinger is guilty of wrongdoing. So, instead of addressing the
question, he attacks the character of Henry Kissinger.</p>

<p><strong><u>True But Irrelevant</u></strong></p>

<p>This tactic is quite simple: the
arguer bases a conclusion on information that is true but not germane to the
issue.</p>

<p><strong>Example:<br></strong>This pain relief product is available over the counter or in
a stronger form with a prescription. But according to this pamphlet, for the
prescription strength product to be effective it must be taken at the immediate
onset of pain, it must be taken every four hours thereafter, and it cannot be
taken with any dairy products. So it actually doesn&rsquo;t matter whether
you use the prescription strength or the over-the-counter strength product.</p>

<p>It is unreasonable to reject the
effectiveness of a product merely because it has modest requirements for use.
All medications have directions and restrictions. So, it cannot be concluded
that just because the prescription strength product has certain guidelines and
restrictions on its use that it is not more effective.</p>

<p>Identifying the conclusion of the argument
you are given is essential in your analysis. From there, recognizing the author&rsquo;s
premises will enable you to identify any flaws in the argument. Only then will
you be able to write an effective analysis.</p>
