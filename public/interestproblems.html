	<h1>Interest Problems</h1></strong></p>

<p>These problems are based on the formula </p>

<p><span class="equation">INTEREST = AMOUNT &times; TIME &times; RATE</span></p>

<p>Often, the key to these problems is that the interest earned
from one account plus the interest earned from another account equals the total
interest earned:</p>

<p><span class="equation">Total Interest =</span> <span class="equation">(Interest from first account)</span> <span class="equation">+ (Interest
from second account)</span></p>

<p>An example will illustrate.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>
A total of $1200 is
deposited in two savings accounts for one year, part at 5% and the remainder at
7%. If $72 was earned in interest, how much was deposited at 5%?</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>410</p></li><li><p>520</p></li><li><p>600</p></li><li><p>650</p></li><li><p>760</p>

<p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>x</em> be the amount deposited at 5%. Then <span class="equation">1200 &ndash; <em>x</em></span>
is the amount deposited at 7%. The interest on these investments is .05<em>x</em>
and .<span class="equation">07(1200 &ndash; <em>x</em>)</span>. Since the total interest is
$72, we get</p>

<p>.05<em>x</em> + .07(1200 &ndash; <em>x</em>)
= 72</p>

<p>.05<em>x</em> + 84 &ndash; .07<em>x</em>
= 72</p>

<p>&ndash;.02<em>x</em> + 84 = 72</p>

<p>&ndash;.02<em>x</em> = &ndash;12</p>

<p><em>x</em> = 600</p>

<p><strong>The answer is (C).</strong></p>
