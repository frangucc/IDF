	<h1>WRITING TECHNIQUE QUESTIONS</h1><p>All coherent writing has a superstructure or blueprint. When
writing, we don&rsquo;t just randomly jot down our thoughts; we organize
our ideas and present them in a logical manner. For instance, we may present
evidence that builds up to a conclusion but intentionally leave the conclusion
unstated, or we may present a position and then contrast it with an opposing
position, or we may draw an extended analogy.</p>

<p>There is an endless number of writing techniques that
authors use to present their ideas, so we cannot classify every method. However,
some techniques are very common to the type of explanatory or opinionated
writing found in GRE passages.</p>

<p><strong>A. Compare and contrast two positions.</strong></p>

<p>This technique has a number of variations,
but the most common and direct is to develop two ideas or systems (comparing)
and then point out why one is better than the other (contrasting). </p>

<p>Some common tip-off phrases to this method of analysis are</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal"><li><p>By contrast</p></li>

<li><p>Similarly</p></li></ol>

<p>Some typical questions for these types of passages are </p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal"><li><p>According to the passage, a central distinction
between a woman&rsquo;s presence and a man&rsquo;s presence is:</p></li>

<li><p>In which of the following ways does the author
imply that birds and reptiles are similar?</p></li></ol>

<p>Writing-technique questions are similar to main idea
questions; except that they ask about how the author <u>presents</u>
his ideas, not about the ideas themselves. Generally, you will be given only
two writing methods to choose from, but each method will have two or more
variations.</p>
<p><strong>Read the passage slowly to get a good understanding of
the issues.</strong></p>

<p>There are two major systems of criminal
procedure in the modern world&mdash;the adversarial and the inquisitorial. The
former is associated with common law tradition and the latter with civil law
tradition. Both systems were historically preceded by the system of private
vengeance in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
administered it privately, either personally or through an agent. The vengeance
system was a system of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
slogan "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
The modern adversarial system is only one historical step removed from the
private vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic features.
Thus, for example, even though the right to institute criminal action has now
been extended to all members of society and even though the police department
has taken over the pretrial investigative functions on behalf of the
prosecution, the adversarial system still leaves the defendant to conduct his
own pretrial investigation. The trial is still viewed as a duel between two
adversaries, refereed by a judge who, at the beginning of the trial has no
knowledge of the investigative background of the case. In the final analysis
the adversarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the
punitive combat.</p>

<p>By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins historically
where the adversarial system stopped its development. It is two historical
steps removed from the system of private vengeance. Therefore, from the
standpoint of legal anthropology, it is historically superior to the
adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the public investigator has
the duty to investigate not just on behalf of the prosecutor but also on behalf
of the defendant. Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to present
to the court not only evidence that may lead to the conviction of the defendant
but also evidence that may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that
both parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence in their
possession. Finally, in an effort to make the trial less like a duel between
two adversaries, the inquisitorial system mandates that the judge take an
active part in the conduct of the trial, with a role that is both directive and
protective.</p>

<p>Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial system. This
system operates on the philosophical premise that in a criminal case the
crucial factor is not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the
goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the court the
commission of the alleged crime.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> (Refer to passage above.)<br>
Which one of the following best describes the
organization of the passage?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Two
systems of criminal justice are compared and contrasted, and one is deemed to
be better than the other.</p></li><li><p>One system of
criminal justice is presented as better than another. Then evidence is offered
to support that claim. </p></li><li><p>Two systems of
criminal justice are analyzed, and one specific example is examined in detail. </p></li><li><p>A
set of examples is furnished. Then a conclusion is drawn from them. </p></li><li><p>The
inner workings of the criminal justice system are illustrated by using two
systems.</p>

</li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Clearly
the author is comparing and contrasting two criminal justice systems. Indeed,
the opening to paragraph two makes this explicit. The author uses a mixed form
of comparison and contrast. He opens the passage by developing (comparing) both
systems and then shifts to developing just the adversarial system. He opens the
second paragraph by contrasting the two criminal justice systems and then
further develops just the inquisitorial system. Finally, he closes by again
contrasting the two systems and implying that the inquisitorial system is
superior.</p>

<p>Only two answer-choices, (A) and (B), have
any real merit. They say essentially the same thing&mdash;though in
different order. Notice in the passage that the author does not indicate which
system is better until the end of paragraph one, and he does not make that
certain until paragraph two. This contradicts the order given by (B). Hence the
answer is (A). (Note: In (A) the order is not specified and therefore is harder
to attack, whereas in (B) the order is definite and therefore is easier to
attack. Remember that a measured response is harder to attack and therefore is
more likely to be the answer.)</p>

<p><strong>B. Show cause and effect.</strong></p>

<p>In this technique, the author typically shows how a
particular cause leads to a certain result or set of results. It is not
uncommon for this method to introduce a sequence of causes and effects. A
causes B, which causes C, which causes D, and so on. Hence B is both the effect
of A and the cause of C. For a discussion of the fallacies associated with this
technique see Causal Reasoning (page 598). The variations on this rhetorical
technique can be illustrated by the following schematics:</p>

<p><strong>Example: <em>(Mini-passage) </em></strong></p>

<p>Thirdly, I worry about the private automobile. It is a
dirty, noisy, wasteful, and lonely means of travel. It pollutes the air, ruins
the safety and sociability of the street, and exercises upon the individual a
discipline which takes away far more freedom than it gives him. It causes an
enormous amount of land to be unnecessarily abstracted from nature and from
plant life and to become devoid of any natural function. It explodes cities,
grievously impairs the whole institution of neighborliness, fragmentizes and
destroys communities. It has already spelled the end of our cities as real
cultural and social communities, and has made impossible the construction of
any others in their place. Together with the airplane, it has crowded out
other, more civilized and more convenient means of transport, leaving older
people, infirm people, poor people and children in a worse situation than they
were a hundred years ago. It continues to lend a terrible element of fragility
to our civilization, placing us in a situation where our life would break down
completely if anything ever interfered with the oil supply.</p>

<p>George F. Kennan</p>

<p>Which of the following best describes the organization of
the passage?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>A
problem is presented and then a possible solution is discussed.</p></li><li><p>The
benefits and demerits of the automobile are compared and contrasted.</p></li><li><p>A
topic is presented and a number of its effects are discussed.</p></li><li><p>A
set of examples is furnished to support a conclusion.</p>
</li>
</ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>This
passage is laden with effects. Kennan introduces the cause, the automobile, in
the opening sentence and from there on presents a series of effects&mdash;the
automobile pollutes, enslaves, and so on. Hence the answer is (C). Note: (D) is
the second-best choice; it is disqualified by two flaws. First, in this
context, "examples" is
not as precise as "effects."
Second, the order is wrong: the conclusion, <em>"I
worry about the private automobile"</em> is
presented first and then the examples: it pollutes, it enslaves, etc.</p>



<p><strong>C. State a position and then give supporting evidence.</strong></p>
<p>This technique is common with opinionated
passages. Equally common is the reverse order. That is, the supporting evidence
is presented and then the position or conclusion is stated. And sometimes the
evidence will be structured to build up to a conclusion which is then left
unstated. If this is done skillfully the reader will be more likely to arrive
at the same conclusion as the author.</p>
