	<h1>Style</h1>
	<p>We have examined the rules that govern the English language,
and we have learned some techniques on structure. But how does a writer make a
piece of writing his own? And how does a writer add interest to his essays? The
way a writer uses words and phrases to add personality to his writing is called
<em>style</em>. A writer is to style as a figure skater is to
skating. A writer can learn all the rules that make his writing correct, just
as a figure skater can learn how to accomplish her jumps and footwork. But just
learning the rules of grammar is not enough to create a well-written essay; learning
just the rules of skating is not enough to earn a gold medal. The writer must
bring his own methods and personality to his writing just as a skater must
invest her own personality and flair to her performance.</p>

<p>Many elements combine to form a writer&rsquo;s style,
and, even though many of these elements can be identified, each is unique to a
writer. Moreover, a good writer does not allow any elements of his style to
stagnate. Rather, he continues to practice writing in order to continually
improve and develop his style. We will touch briefly on how you can develop
your writing style, but first let&rsquo;s look at some specific elements of
style.</p>
