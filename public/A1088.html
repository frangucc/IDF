If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p>A bite from the tsetse fly
invariably paralyzes <u>its victims unless an antidote is administered</u> within two
hours.</div><div class="options"><ol

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect since it is unclear whether the victim or the fly should
receive the antidote.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is incorrect since <em>is</em> is
more direct than <em>can be</em>.</p>

<p>Choice (C) is incorrect. A statement of fact should be
expressed in the present tense, not the past tense.</p>

<p>Choice (D) is wordy. A pronoun should be used for the phrase
<em>the victims</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (E) is the answer</strong> since <em>they</em>
correctly identifies who should receive the antidote.<strong></p>
