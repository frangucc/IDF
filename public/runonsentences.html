	<h1>Run-On Sentences</h1>
	<p>A <em>run-on sentence </em>contains one or more
independent clauses but does not have all the proper words and marks of
punctuation that are required to join independent clauses.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  David went on a field trip to an aquarium with
his classmates and they saw a large variety of fish.</p>

<p>In this example, two independent clauses are
joined with a coordinating conjunction, but there is no comma. This type of
run-on sentence is called a <em>fused</em> sentence. A fused sentence
can also lack both a comma and a conjunction such as in the following example:</p>

<p>The debate over alien existence will probably
continue for years some are sure they have seen aliens.</p>

<p>This next sentence contains a comma but no
coordinating conjunction:</p>

<p>Many people believe in the powers of a
psychic, sometimes even detectives depend on psychics to help solve crimes.</p>

<p>Because this sentence contains a comma but no
coordinating conjunction, it is called a <em>comma splice</em>.</p>

<p>To correct run-on sentences in your writing</p>

<p>(<strong>Step 1</strong>) identify them.</p>

<p>(<strong>Step 2</strong>) revise them.</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 1</strong></u></p>

<p>&ndash; Identify run-on
sentences in your writing.</p>

<p>To find run-on sentences in your writing, first analyze each
sentence. In your analysis, mark the subject and verb by underlining the
subject once and the verb twice. Following are some examples:</p>

<p><u>Osteoporosis</u> is very
common among women but <u>drinking</u> milk and <u>taking</u>
calcium supplements can help prevent it.</p>

<p>This example is a fused sentence because it
contains two independent clauses linked by a coordinating conjunction but no
comma.</p>

<p><u>History</u> provides us with interesting
stories, <u>it</u> also helps us in the future because we can learn
from mistakes made in history.</p>

<p>This example is a comma splice because it
contains two independent clauses linked by a comma but no coordinating
conjunction. These examples contain only two independent clauses that are not
combined correctly. Many writers also link multiple clauses incorrectly. If you
are prone to this error, it is important that you take the time to go through
each sentence and identify the subjects and verbs. From there, you can revise
your sentences accurately.</p>

<p><u><strong>Step 2</strong></u> </p>

<p>&ndash; Revise your run-on sentences by using one of
five methods:</p>

<p>&bull; Separate the clauses in to
complete sentences.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>(Run-on) <br>
  Working together as a team is more
productive than working individually, a team can get more accomplished than one
person. </p>

<p>(Revised) Working together as a team is more
productive than working individually. A team can get more accomplished than one
person.</p>

<p>&bull; Link the clauses with a semicolon.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>(Run-on) <br>
  Writing is great therapy letting off
steam through the written word is a good way to work through frustration.</p>

<p>(Revised) Writing is great therapy; letting
off steam through the written word is a good way to work through frustration.</p>

<p>&bull; Link the clauses with a
comma and a coordinating conjunction.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>(Run-on) <br>
  I went to Florida last week to go to
Disney World with a friend but it rained the whole time that I was there. </p>

<p>(Revised) I went to Florida last week to go
to Disney World with a friend, but it rained the whole time that I was there.</p>

<p>&bull; Rewrite the clauses to form
just one independent clause.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>(Run-on) <br>
  This summer has been a very hot one,
it has been humid also.</p>

<p>(Revised) This summer has been a very hot and
humid one.</p>

<p>&bull; Rewrite the clauses to form
one independent clause with an introductory dependent clause.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>(Run-on) <br>
  We re-painted our house, the old
paint was peeling and fading. </p>

<p>(Revised) Because the old paint was peeling
and fading, we re-painted our house.</p>

<p>Make sure you review your work after making
revisions to ensure that all run-on sentences have indeed been corrected. In
addition, try to use all five methods of revision in your writing; don&rsquo;t
correct each run-on with the same method. Using different forms of revision
will result in varying sentence patterns, which will enhance your writing
style. We will discuss writing style shortly as well as strengthening the
structure of your essay. First, however, let&rsquo;s make sure you know how
to apply the rules of punctuation we just covered.</p>
