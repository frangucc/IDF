	<h1>Misplaced Modifiers</h1>
	<p>A modifier is a phrase or a clause that describes something.
A misplaced modifier, therefore, is one that describes the wrong item in a
sentence, often creating an illogical statement.</p>

<p>  As a general rule, a modifier should be
placed as close as possible to what it modifies.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Following are some useful tips for protecting
your person and property from the FBI.</p>

<p>As written, the sentence implies that the FBI
is a threat to your person and property. To correct the sentence put the
modifier <em>from the FBI</em> next to the word it modifies, <em>tips</em>:</p>

<p>Following are some useful tips from the FBI
for protecting your person and property.</p>

<p>  When a phrase begins a sentence, make sure
that it modifies the subject of the sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
  Coming around the corner, a few moments
passed before I could recognize my old home.</p>

<p>As worded, the sentence implies that the
moments were coming around the corner. The sentence can be corrected as
follows:</p>

<p>As I came around the corner, a few moments
passed before I could recognize my old home.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Coming around the corner, I paused a few
moments before I could recognize my old home.</p>
