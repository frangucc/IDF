If you think the sentence as written is better than the alternatives, choose A, which merely repeats the underlined part; otherwise choose one of the alternatives.<p><u>Due to the chemical spill, the

spill.</p></li><li><p>Due to the chemical spill, the

</li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span class="solution">Solution:</span>Choice
(A) is incorrect. Although many educated writers and speakers begin sentences
with <em>due to</em>, it is almost always incorrect.</p>

<p>Choice (B) is incorrect: it is both redundant and awkward.</p>

<p>Choice (C) is incorrect. The past perfect <em>had been
delayed</em> implies the delay no longer exists. <br>Hence, the meaning of
the sentence has been changed.</p>

<p><strong>Choice (D) is correct</strong>. In
general, <em>due to</em> should not be used as a substitute for <em>because
of, owing to, by reason of</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Choice (E) is incorrect. The future progressive <em>will
be delaying</em> is unnecessary and ponderous. Had choice (E) used the
simple future <em>will delay</em>, it would have been better that
choice (D) because then it would be more direct and active.<strong></p>
