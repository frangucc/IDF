	<h1>Higher Order Inequalities</h1>

<p></strong>These inequalities have variables whose
exponents are greater than 1. For example, <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</span>  and <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0</span>. The number line is often helpful in
solving these types of inequalities.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
 For which values of <em>x</em>
is <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&minus;6<em>x</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5</span>?</p>

<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>First,
replace the inequality symbol with an equal symbol: <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;6<em>x</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5</span></p>

<p>Adding 6<em>x</em> and 5 to both sides yields <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;6<em>x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span></p>

<p>Factoring yields (see General Trinomials in the  Factoring section) (<em>x</em> + 5)(<em>x</em> + 1) = 0</p>

<p>Setting each factor to 0 yields <em>x</em> + 5
=0 and <span class="equation"><em>x</em> + 1 =0</span></p>

<p>Or <em>x</em> = &ndash;5 and <em>x</em>
= &ndash;1</p>

<p>Now, the only numbers at which the expression can change
sign are &ndash;5 and &ndash;1. So &ndash;5 and &ndash;1 divide
the number line into three intervals. Let&rsquo;s set up a number line and
choose test points in each interval:</p>

<p>When <em>x</em> = &ndash;6, <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&minus;6<em>x</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5</span> becomes 36 > 31. This is
true. Hence, all numbers in Interval I satisfy the inequality. That is, <em>x</em>
< &ndash;5. When <span class="equation"><em>x</em> = &ndash;3</span>, <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&minus;6<em>x</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5</span> becomes 9 > 13. This is
false. Hence, no numbers in Interval II satisfy the inequality. When <em>x</em>
= 0, <span class="equation"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&minus;6<em>x</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5</span> becomes
<span class="equation">0 > &ndash;5</span>. This is true. Hence, all numbers in Interval III satisfy
the inequality. That is, <em>x</em> > &ndash;1. The graph of
the solution follows:</p>

<p>Note, if the original inequality had included the
greater-than-or-equal symbol, &ge;, the solution set would have included
both &ndash;5 and &ndash;1. On the graph, this would have been
indicated by filling in the circles above &ndash;5 and &ndash;1. The
open circles indicate that &ndash;5 and &ndash;1 are not part of the
solution.</p>

<p>Summary of steps for solving higher order inequalities:</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal"><li><p>Replace the inequality symbol with an equal symbol.</p></li>

<li><p>Move all terms to one side of the equation (usually the
left side).</p></li>

<li><p>Factor the equation.</p></li>

<li><p>Set the factors equal to 0 to find zeros.</p></li>

<li><p>Choose test points on either side of the zeros.</p></li>

<li><p>If a test point satisfies the original inequality, then
all numbers in that interval satisfy the inequality. Similarly, if a test point
does not satisfy the inequality, then no numbers in that interval satisfy the
inequality.</p></li></ol>
