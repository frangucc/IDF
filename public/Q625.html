</div>
<div class="passage"><p>According to usage and conventions which are
at last being questioned but have by no means been overcome, the social
presence of a woman is different in kind from that of a man. A man&rsquo;s
presence is dependent upon the promise of power which he embodies. If the
promise is large and credible his presence is striking. If it is small or
incredible, he is found to have little presence. The promised power may be
moral, physical, temperamental, economic, social, sexual&mdash;but its
object is always exterior to the man. A man&rsquo;s presence suggests what
he is capable of doing to you or for you. His presence may be fabricated, in
the sense that he pretends to be capable of what he is not. But the pretense is
always toward a power which he exercises on others.</p>

<p>By contrast, a woman&rsquo;s presence expresses her own
attitude to herself, and defines what can and cannot be done to her. Her
presence is manifest in her gestures, voices, opinions, expressions, clothes,
chosen surroundings, taste&mdash;indeed there is nothing she can do which
does not contribute to her presence. Presence for a woman is so intrinsic to
her person that men tend to think of it as an almost physical emanation, a kind
of heat or smell or aura.</p>

<p>To be born a woman has been to be born, within an allotted
and confined space, into the keeping of men. The social presence of women has
developed as a result of their ingenuity in living under such tutelage within
such a limited space. But this has been at the cost of a woman&rsquo;s self
being split into two. A woman must continually watch herself. Whilst she is
walking across a room or whilst she is weeping at the death of her father, she
can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest
childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually.</p>

<p>And so she comes to consider the <em>surveyor</em>
and the <em>surveyed</em> within her as the two constituent yet
always distinct elements of her identity as a woman. </p>

<p>She has to survey everything she is and everything she does
because how she appears to others, and ultimately how she appears to men, is of
crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her
own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as
herself by another. Men survey women before treating them. Consequently how a
woman appears to a man can determine how she will be treated. To acquire some
control over this process, women must contain it and internalize it. That part
of a woman&rsquo;s self which is the surveyor treats the part which is the
surveyed so as to demonstrate to others how her whole self would like to be
treated. And this exemplary treatment of herself by herself constitutes her
presence. Every woman&rsquo;s presence regulates what is and is not "permissible"
within her presence. Every one of her actions&mdash;whatever its direct
purpose or motivation&mdash;is also read as an indication of how she would
like to be treated. If a woman throws a glass on the floor, this is an example
of how she treats her own emotion of anger and so of how she would wish to be
treated by others. If a man does the same, his action is only read as an
expression of his anger. If a woman makes a good joke this is an example of how
she treats the joker in herself and accordingly of how she as joker-woman would
like to be treated by others. Only a man can make a good joke for its own sake.</p>The passage portrays women as </div><div
