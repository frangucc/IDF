</div>
<div class="passage"><p>Many readers, I suspect, will
take the title of this article [<em>Women, Fire, and Dangerous
Things</em>] as suggesting that women, fire, and dangerous things have
something in common&mdash;say, that women are fiery and dangerous. Most
feminists I&rsquo;ve mentioned it to have loved the title for that reason,
though some have hated it for the same reason. But the chain of inference&mdash;from
conjunction to categorization to commonality&mdash;is the norm. The
inference is based on the common idea of what it means to be in the same
category: things are categorized together on the basis of what they have in
common. The idea that categories are defined by common properties is not only
our everyday folk theory of what a category is, it is also the principle
technical theory&mdash;one that has been with us for more than two thousand
years.</p>

<p>The classical view that categories are based on shared
properties is not entirely wrong. We often do categorize things on that basis. But
that is only a small part of the story. In recent years it has become clear
that categorization is far more complex than that. A new theory of
categorization, called <em>prototype theory</em>, has emerged. It
shows that human categorization is based on principles that extend far beyond
those envisioned in the classical theory. One of our goals is to survey the
complexities of the way people really categorize. For example, the title of
this book was inspired by the Australian aboriginal language Dyirbal, which has
a category, <em>balan</em>, that actually includes women, fire, and
dangerous things. It also includes birds that are <em>not</em>
dangerous, as well as exceptional animals, such as the platypus, bandicoot, and
echidna. This is not simply a matter of categorization by common properties.</p>

<p>Categorization is not a matter to be taken lightly. There is
nothing more basic than categorization to our thought, perception, action and
speech. Every time we see something as a <em>kind</em> of thing,
for example, a tree, we are categorizing. Whenever we reason about <em>kinds</em>
of things&mdash;chairs, nations, illnesses, emotions, any kind of thing at
all&mdash;we are employing categories. Whenever we intentionally perform
any <em>kind</em> of action, say something as mundane as writing
with a pencil, hammering with a hammer, or ironing clothes, we are using
categories. The particular action we perform on that occasion is a <em>kind</em>
of motor activity, that is, it is in a particular category of motor actions. They
are never done in exactly the same way, yet despite the differences in
particular movements, they are all movements of a kind, and we know how to make
movements of that kind. And any time we either produce or understand any
utterance of any reasonable length, we are employing dozens if not hundreds of
categories: categories of speech sounds, of words, of phrases and clauses, as
well as conceptual categories. Without the ability to categorize, we could not
function at all, either in the physical world or in our social and intellectual
lives.</p>
According to the author,</p>

<p>I. categorizing is a fundamental activity of people.</p>

<p>II. whenever a word refers to a kind of thing, it signifies
a category.</p>

<p>III. one has to be able to categorize in order to function
in our culture.</div><div class="options"><ol

is a description question, so we must find the points in the passage from which
the statements were drawn.</p>

<p>Remember, the answer to a description question will not
directly quote a statement from the passage, but it will be closely related to
one&mdash;often a paraphrase.</p>

<p>The needed references for Statements I, II, and III are all
contained in the closing paragraph.
<br><strong>The answer is (E).</strong></p>
