  <h1>Developing Your Style</h1>
  <p>Your goal as a writer is to create
interest and coherence through your unique writing style. Using figures of
speech and maintaining consistent use of tone, diction and person are effective
ways to create interest. Using transitions creates coherence. Also remember
that part of creating coherence is being concise. Use only the details that are
necessary to support your topic and avoid tedious description. This is not to
say that you should avoid vivid imagery, but that you should take care to
ensure that your information adds to your writing rather than detracts from
your writing.</p>

<p>In taking all of these elements of style into account, the
most important aspect to remember about developing your style is that it only comes
through practice. Practice your writing and proofread, proofread, proofread. If
you do all of these things, you will be well on your way to becoming an
effective, skillful writer. Are you ready to start practicing? Let&rsquo;s
move on and discuss the two different essays you will be asked to write.</p>
