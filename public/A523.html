Three hours later, Ship B leaves the same port in the same direction traveling
25 mph. At what time does Ship B pass Ship A?</div><div class="options"><ol

class="solution">Solution:</span>Let
<em>t</em> be time that Ship B has been traveling. Then <em>t</em>
+ 3 is time that Ship A has been traveling. The distance traveled by Ship B is <EM>D</EM>
= <em>rt</em> = 25<em>t</em>, and Ship A&rsquo;s
distance is 15(<em>t</em> + 3). At the moment Ship B passes Ship A,
they will have traveled the same distance. <br>Hence, </p>

<p>25<em>t</em> = 15(<em>t</em> + 3)</p>

<p>25<em>t</em> = 15<em>t</em> + 45</p>

<p>10<em>t</em> = 45</p>

<p><em>t</em> = 4.5</p>

<p>Since Ship B left port at 4 PM and overtook Ship A in 4.5
hours, it passed Ship A at 8:30 PM. <strong>The answer is
(A).</strong></p>
