	<h1>The Six Questions</h1></p>



<p>The key to performing well on the passages is
not the particular reading technique you use (so long as it&rsquo;s not
speed reading). Rather the key is to become completely familiar with the
question types&mdash;there are only six&mdash;so that you can
anticipate the questions that <em>might</em> be asked as you read
the passage and answer those that <em>are</em> asked more quickly
and efficiently. As you become familiar with the six question types, you will
gain an intuitive sense for the places from which questions are likely to be
drawn. Note, the order in which the questions are asked <u>roughly</u>
corresponds to the order in which the main issues are presented in the passage.
Early questions should correspond to information given early in the passage,
and so on.</p>
