	<h1>Elimination Strategies</h1>

<p><strong>1. On hard problems, if you are asked to find the least (or
greatest) number, then eliminate the least (or greatest) answer-choice.</strong></p>

<p>This rule also applies to easy and medium problems. When
people guess on these types of problems, they most often choose either the
least or the greatest number. But if the least or the greatest number were the
answer, most people would answer the problem correctly, and it therefore would
not be a hard problem.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
 What is the maximum
number of points common to the intersection of a square and a triangle if no
two sides coincide?</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>4</p></li><li><p>5</p></li><li><p>6</p></li><li><p>8</p></li><li><p>9</p>

<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>By the above rule, we eliminate answer-choice (E).</p>

<p><strong>2. On hard problems, eliminate the
answer-choice "not enough
information."</strong></p>

<p>When people cannot solve a problem, they most often choose
the answer-choice "not enough information."
But if this were the answer, then it would not be a "hard"
problem.</p>

<p>Quantitative comparison problems are the lone exception to
this rule. For often what makes a quantitative comparison problem hard is
deciding whether there is enough information to make a decision.</p>

<p><strong>3. On hard problems, eliminate answer-choices that
merely repeat numbers from the problem.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> <br>
If the sum of x and 20
is 8 more than the difference of 10 and y, what is the value of <span class="equation">x + y?</span></div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>&ndash;2</p></li><li><p>8</p></li><li><p>9</p></li><li><p>28</p></li><li><p>not
enough information</p>
</ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>By
the above rule, we eliminate choice (B) since it merely repeats the number 8
from the problem. By Strategy 2, we would also eliminate choice (E). <strong>Caution:</strong>
If choice (B) contained more than the number 8, say, <span class="equation">8&nbsp;+&nbsp;&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span></span>, then it would not be eliminated by
the above rule.</p>

<p><strong>4. On hard problems, eliminate answer-choices that can be
derived from elementary operations.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>
  In the figure below, what is
the perimeter of parallelogram ABCD?</p>

<p><img width=245 height=145
src="image161.gif"></div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>12</p></li><li><p><span class="equation">10&nbsp;+&nbsp;6&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span></span></p>
</li><li><p><span class="equation">20&nbsp;+&nbsp;&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">2</span></span></p>
</li><li><p>24</p></li><li><p>not
enough information</p>

<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Using
the above rule, we eliminate choice (D) since <span class="equation">24&nbsp;=&nbsp;8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3</span>. Further, using Strategy 2, eliminate
choice (E). Note, 12 was offered as an answer-choice because some people will interpret
the drawing as a rectangle tilted halfway on its side and therefore expect it
to have one-half its original area.</p>

<p><strong>5. After you have eliminated as many answer-choices as you
can, choose from the more complicated or more unusual answer-choices remaining.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> <br>
Suppose you were
offered the following answer-choices:</div><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p><span class="equation">4&nbsp;+&nbsp;&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">3</span></span></p>
</li><li><p><span class="equation">4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&radic;<span style="border-top:1px solid #000000;">3</span></span></p>
</li><li><p>8</p></li><li><p>10</p></li><li><p>12</p>
<p></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Then
you would choose either (A) or (B).</p>

<p>We have been discussing hard problems but have not mentioned
how to identify a hard problem. Most of the time, we have an intuitive feel for
whether a problem is hard or easy. But on tricky problems (problems that appear
easy but are actually hard) our intuition can fail us.</p>

<p>On the test, your first question will be of medium
difficulty. If you answer it correctly, the next question will be a little
harder. If you again answer it correctly, the next question will be harder
still, and so on. If your math skills are strong and you are not making any
mistakes, you should reach the medium-hard or hard problems by about the fifth
problem. Although this is not very precise, it can be quite helpful. Once you
have passed the fifth question, you should be alert to subtleties in any
seemingly simple problems.</p>
