cars, and each model comes with 5 options. How many different types of cars
does the carmaker sell?</div><div class="options"><ol

<div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span> For
the first model, there are 5 options. So there are 5 different types of cars in
this model. For the second model, there are the same number of different types
of cars. Likewise, for the other two types of models. <br>Hence, there are <span class="equation">5 + 5 +
5 + 5 = 20</span> different types of cars. <strong>The answer is
(E).</strong></p>

<p>This problem illustrates the <em>Fundamental Principle
of Counting</em>:</p>

<p>If an event occurs <em>m</em> times, and each of
the <em>m</em> events is followed by a second event which occurs <em>k</em>
times, then the first event follows the second event <em>m</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<em>k</em> times.</p>
