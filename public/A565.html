of homes: ranch-style homes and townhomes. There are twice as many townhomes as
ranch-style homes. There are 3 times as many townhomes with pools than without

class="solution">Solution:</span>Since
there are twice as many townhomes as ranch-style homes, the probability of
selecting a townhome is 2/3. Now,
"there are 3 times as many townhomes with pools
than without pools." So the probability that a
townhome will have a pool is 3/4. <br>Hence, the probability of selecting a
townhome with a pool is </p>
