	<h1>MAIN IDEA QUESTIONS</h1>
  <p><strong>Read the passage slowly to get a good understanding of
the issues.</strong></p>

<p>There are two major systems of criminal
procedure in the modern world&mdash;the adversarial and the inquisitorial. The
former is associated with common law tradition and the latter with civil law
tradition. Both systems were historically preceded by the system of private
vengeance in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
administered it privately, either personally or through an agent. The vengeance
system was a system of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
slogan "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
The modern adversarial system is only one historical step removed from the
private vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic features.
Thus, for example, even though the right to institute criminal action has now
been extended to all members of society and even though the police department
has taken over the pretrial investigative functions on behalf of the
prosecution, the adversarial system still leaves the defendant to conduct his
own pretrial investigation. The trial is still viewed as a duel between two
adversaries, refereed by a judge who, at the beginning of the trial has no
knowledge of the investigative background of the case. In the final analysis
the adversarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the
punitive combat.</p>

<p>By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins historically
where the adversarial system stopped its development. It is two historical
steps removed from the system of private vengeance. Therefore, from the
standpoint of legal anthropology, it is historically superior to the
adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the public investigator has
the duty to investigate not just on behalf of the prosecutor but also on behalf
of the defendant. Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to present
to the court not only evidence that may lead to the conviction of the defendant
but also evidence that may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that
both parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence in their
possession. Finally, in an effort to make the trial less like a duel between
two adversaries, the inquisitorial system mandates that the judge take an
active part in the conduct of the trial, with a role that is both directive and
protective.</p>

<p>Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial system. This
system operates on the philosophical premise that in a criminal case the
crucial factor is not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the
goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the court the
commission of the alleged crime.</p>

<p>The main idea is usually stated in the last&mdash;occasionally
the first&mdash;sentence of the first paragraph. If it&rsquo;s not
there, it will probably be the last sentence of the entire passage. Main idea
questions are usually the first questions asked. </p>

<p>Some common main idea questions are</p>

<ol style="list-style:decimal"><li><p>Which one of the following
best expresses the main idea of the passage?</p></li>

<li><p>The primary purpose of
the passage is to . . . </p></li>

<li><p>In the passage, the
author&rsquo;s primary concern is to discuss . . .</p></li></ol>

<p>Main idea questions are rarely difficult; after all the
author wants to clearly communicate her ideas to you. If, however, after the
first reading, you don&rsquo;t have a feel for the main idea, review the
first and last sentence of each paragraph; these will give you a quick overview
of the passage.</p>

<p>Because main idea questions are relatively easy, the GRE
writers try to obscure the correct answer by surrounding it with close
answer-choices ("detractors")
that either overstate or understate the author&rsquo;s main point. Answer-choices
that stress specifics tend to understate the main idea; choices that go beyond
the scope of the passage tend to overstate the main idea.</p>



<p>The answer to a main idea question will
summarize the author&rsquo;s argument, yet be neither too specific nor too
broad.</p>



<p>In most GRE passages the author&rsquo;s primary purpose
is to persuade the reader to accept her opinion. Occasionally, it is to
describe something.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> (Refer to passage above.)</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the passage is to</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>explain
why the inquisitorial system is the best system of criminal justice</p></li><li><p>explain
how the adversarial and the inquisitorial systems of criminal justice both
evolved from the system of private vengeance</p></li><li><p>show
how the adversarial and inquisitorial systems of criminal justice can both
complement and hinder each other&rsquo;s development</p></li><li><p>show
how the adversarial and inquisitorial systems of criminal justice are being
combined into a new and better system</p></li><li><p>analyze
two systems of criminal justice and deduce which one is better</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>The
answer to a main idea question will summarize the passage without going beyond
it. (A) violates these criteria by <em>overstating</em> the scope
of the passage. The comparison in the passage is between two specific systems,
not between <em>all</em> systems. (A) would be a good answer if "best"
were replaced with "better."
<strong>Beware of extreme words</strong>. (B) violates the criteria
by <em>understating</em> the scope of the passage. Although the
evolution of both the adversarial and the inquisitorial systems is discussed in
the passage, it is done to show why one is superior to the other. As to (C) and
(D), both can be quickly dismissed since neither is mentioned in the passage. Finally,
the passage does two things: it presents two systems of criminal justice and
shows why one is better than the other. (E) aptly summarizes this, so it is the
best answer.<strong></p>

<p></p></strong>

<p>Following is a mini-passage. These exercises are interspersed
among the sections of this section and are written to the same specifications
as actual GRE passages. Because the mini-passages are short and designed to
test only one issue, they are more tractable than a full passage.</p>

<p><strong>Application: <em>(Mini-passage)</em>
</strong></p>

<p>As Xenophanes recognized as long ago as the sixth century
before Christ, whether or not God made man in His own image, it is certain that
man makes gods in his. The gods of Greek mythology first appear in the writings
of Homer and Hesiod, and, from the character and actions of these picturesque
and, for the most part, friendly beings, we get some idea of the men who made
them and brought them to Greece.</p>

<p>But ritual is more fundamental than mythology, and the study
of Greek ritual during recent years has shown that, beneath the belief or
skepticism with which the Olympians were regarded, lay an older magic, with
traditional rites for the promotion of fertility by the celebration of the
annual cycle of life and death, and the propitiation of unfriendly ghosts, gods
or demons. Some such survivals were doubtless widespread, and, prolonged into
classical times, probably made the substance of Eleusinian and Orphic
mysteries. Against this dark and dangerous background arose Olympic mythology
on the one hand and early philosophy and science on the other.</p>

<p>In classical times the need of a creed higher than the
Olympian was felt, and Aeschylus, Sophocles and Plato finally evolved from the
pleasant but crude polytheism the idea of a single, supreme and righteous Zeus.
But the decay of Olympus led to a revival of old and the invasion of new magic
cults among the people, while some philosophers were looking to a vision of the
uniformity of nature under divine and universal law.</p>

<p>From Sir William Cecil Dampier, <em>A Shorter History
of Science</em>,  1957, Meridian Books.</p>

<p>The main idea of the passage is that</div><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>Olympic
mythology evolved from ancient rituals and gave rise to early philosophy</p></li><li><p>early
moves toward viewing nature as ordered by divine and universal law coincided
with monotheistic impulses and the disintegration of classical mythology</p></li><li><p>early
philosophy followed from classical mythology</p></li><li><p>the
practice of science, i.e., empiricism, preceded scientific theory</p>

<p></p></li></ol></div><div
id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Most
main idea questions are rather easy. This one is not&mdash;mainly, because
the passage itself is not an easy read. Recall that to find the main idea of a
passage, we check the last sentence of the first paragraph; if it&rsquo;s
not there, we check the closing of the passage. Reviewing the last sentence of
the first paragraph, we see that it hardly presents a statement, let alone the
main idea. Turning to the closing line of the passage, however, we find the key
to this question. The passage describes a struggle for ascendancy amongst four
opposing philosophies: (magic and traditional rites) vs. (Olympic mythology)
vs. (monotheism [Zeus]) vs. (early philosophy and science). The closing lines
of the passage summarize this and add that Olympic mythology lost out to
monotheism (Zeus), while magical cults enjoyed a revival and the germ of
universal law was planted. Thus <strong>the answer is (B).</strong></p>

<p>As to the other choices, (A) is false.
"Olympic mythology [arose] on one hand and early
philosophy and science on the other" (closing to paragraph
two); thus they initially developed in parallel. (C) is also false. It makes
the same type of error as (A). Finally, (D) is not mentioned in the passage.</p>
