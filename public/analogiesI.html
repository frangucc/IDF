	<h1>Analogies I</h1>

<p>In analogy questions, the relationship between the words is
more important than the meanings of the words themselves. Your task in
answering an analogy question is to identify the relationship between the given
pair of words and then choose the answer-pair with the most similar
relationship. Although esoteric (difficult, known to only a few people) words
can make an analogy problem difficult (but not impossible), many of the hardest
analogies involve simple, common words but with subtle relationships. Analogies
are probably the easiest type of question to improve on, in part, because they
fall into nice patterns. Once you become familiar with these patterns and
become wise to the traps, you&rsquo;ll find yourself knocking off these
questions rapidly.</p>

<p><strong>Before You Look at the Answer-Choices, Think
of a Short Sentence That Expresses the Relationship Between the Two
Words.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> FISH : SCHOOL ::</strong></p>

<p>How are FISH and SCHOOL related? Well, a group of fish is
called a school.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> JOURNALIST : TYPEWRITER ::</strong></p>

<p>Paraphrase: A journalist uses a typewriter as a tool of his
trade.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> ORCHESTRA : MUSICIAN ::</strong><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>story
: comedian</p></li><li><p>band : singer</p></li><li><p>garden
: leaf</p></li><li><p>troupe : actor</p></li><li><p>government
: lawyer</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>Paraphrase: "An ORCHESTRA<strong>
</strong>is comprised of MUSICIANS." Now, a
STORY is not comprised of COMEDIANS. Eliminate (A). A BAND may have a SINGER,
but a BAND is not comprised of SINGERS: there may be a drummer, guitarist, etc.
Eliminate (B). Similarly, a GARDEN is comprised of more than just LEAVES. Eliminate
(C). But a TROUPE is comprised of ACTORS. <strong>The answer, therefore,
is (D).</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Most students who, at first, struggle with analogies do so
because they take a global view of the problem. They read the problem as they
would a reading passage, looking for the feel, tone, or general relationship
between the given words. However, analogies require an exactness and precision
more similar to that used in math. You are looking for a relationship between
the given words. If more than one answer-choice fits your inital paraphrase,
hone it down until it captures a precise relationship between the given words. Don&rsquo;t
just choose the answer that feels right, instead adjust your paraphrase to
capture the essence of the relationship, and then apply it methodically to the
answer-choices, eliminating any that do not fit the paraphrase.</p>

<p><strong>If More Than One Answer-Choice Fits Your
Paraphrase, Make Your Paraphrase More Specific.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> CLUB : GOLF ::</strong><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>type
: book</p></li><li><p>ball : soccer</p></li><li><p>glove
: baseball</p></li><li><p>racket : tennis</p></li><li><p>board
: chess</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>

Paraphrase: "A CLUB is used to
play GOLF." However, this paraphrase eliminates
only answer-choice (A). A more specific paraphrase is: A CLUB is used to strike
a ball in the game of GOLF. Similarly, a RACKET is used to strike a ball in the
game of TENNIS. <strong>The answer is (D).</strong>
<p>Words have different meanings and connotations for different
people. So sometimes you may form a paraphrase that does not work with any of
the answer-choices. This may occur because you noticed a superficial
relationship between the words, but the test writers are looking for a subtle,
deeper relationship. If your paraphrase does not work for any of the
answer-choices, try to think of unusual, often bookish, meanings of the given
words.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>For Analogies Involving Verbs, Try Forming a
Paraphrase Using the Infinitive, or "to",
form of the Verb. These Analogies Can Often Be Written with the Following
Structure: To ____ Is To ____ .</strong></p>

<p>You may already use this technique naturally. However,
identifying methods that we may use intuitively increases our understanding of
them and allows us to use them more efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
<strong>CRAWL : PROCEED</strong></p>

<p>TO CRAWL is TO PROCEED slowly.</p>

<p><strong>SKIM : READ</strong></p>

<p>TO SKIM is TO READ quickly and superficially.</p>

<p><strong>ASSUAGE : SORROW</strong></p>

<p>TO ASSUAGE is TO soothe or lessen the SORROW of another.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Hesitate to Reverse the Order
of the Given Words in Your Paraphrase.</strong></p>

<p>When forming a paraphrase of the given pair, it is often
more natural to mention the second word first. Of course, the answer-choice
must also be paraphrased in reverse order. Be alert to wrong answer-choices
that have the same relationship as the original pair but in the wrong order. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> POTTERY : SHARD ::</strong></p>

<p>Paraphrase: A SHARD is a piece of broken POTTERY.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> SERMON : HOMILY ::</strong></p>

<p>Paraphrase: A HOMILY is a long moralistic SERMON.</p>

<p><strong>If You Don&rsquo;t Recognize a Word, Use
the Techniques We Discussed in the Antonym Section to Conjure Its
Meaning.</strong></p>

<p>The parts of speech are consistent throughout an analogy
problem. Hence, if the given pair is an adjective and a noun, then each answer-pair
will be an adjective and a noun, in that order. This helps you determine the
intended meaning when one (or both) of the given words belongs to more than one
part of speech.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> PURIFY : DROSS ::</strong><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>defile
: litter</p></li><li><p>purge : rival</p></li><li><p>align
: objects</p></li><li><p>effectuate : thespian</p></li><li><p>vest
: assets</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>

You know what PURIFY means (to cleanse). But DROSS is
probably less familiar. Does it perhaps mean the opposite of PURIFY (to
pollute). This would make it a verb, but all the second words in the
answer-choice pairs are nouns. So DROSS must be a noun as well. Perhaps DROSS
is what is removed when something is PURIFIED. Similarly, political RIVALS are
removed in a PURGE. <strong>The answer is (B).</strong></p>

<strong>If You Don&rsquo;t Recognize a Word, Use
the Techniques We Discussed in the Antonym Section to Conjure Its
Meaning.</strong></p>

<p>Educated guessing is a very useful technique on the GRE. If
you can eliminate one or more answer-choices, you will probably increase your
score by guessing.</p></div>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<strong> CORROSION : IRON ::</strong><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>sloth
: energy</p></li><li><p>disease : vision</p></li><li><p>atrophy
: muscle</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>

In choices (A) and (C) there are clear and reasonably
necessary relationships between the words of each pair: a SLOTHFUL person lacks
ENERGY, and ATROPHY means "the wasting away of
MUSCLE." But in choice (B) there is no necessary
relationship between the words: most DISEASES have no effect on VISION. Hence,
eliminate choice (B). <strong>The correct answer is (C)</strong>
since CORROSION is the wasting away of IRON, just as ATROPHY is the wasting
away of MUSCLE.
<p>Be careful when eliminating answer-choices to hard analogy
problems because the relationship may not be strong, or it may actually be
between esoteric (rare) meanings of the words. This is often what makes a hard
analogy problem hard.</p>

<p>Study the following pairs of words that have no clear relationship
between them.</p>

<p><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>DESIRE
: OPTIMIST :: (An optimist may or may not have desires.)</p></li><li><p>REPUDIATE
: FRIEND :: (One may or may not repudiate a friend, though typically one does
not.)</p></li><li><p>DISMANTLE : EQUAL ::</p></li><li><p>CONTROVERSY
: SCIENTIFIC ::</p></li><li><p>KINDERGARTEN :
MANIPULATE :: </p></li></ol></div></p>

<p><strong>Watch Out For Eye-Catchers</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the writers of the GRE often set traps by
offering an answer-pair that reminds you of the original pair but has a
different relationship. The correct answer-pair, of course, will have the same
relationship as the original pair, but the words in the answer will typically
be in an entirely different category. The following diagram indicates how the
relationship functions between the original pair and the correct answer, and
how the relationship functions between the original pair and the eye-catcher.</p>

<p>MONARCHY is an eye-catcher since it reminds one of
GOVERNMENT&mdash;it&rsquo;s a type of government. Now, a paraphrase for
ANARCHY : GOVERNMENT is ANARCHY is the absence of GOVERNMENT. Similarly,
FREETHINKING is the absence of DOGMATIC thought. Notice that GOVERNMENT and
DOGMATIST are in different categories: a DOGMATIST is not a GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
<strong>EXCERPT : NOVEL ::</strong><div class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>critique
: play</p></li><li><p>review : manuscript</p></li><li><p>swatch
: cloth</p></li><li><p>foreword : preface</p></li><li><p>recital
: performance</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>

Notice how in answer-choice (B) MANUSCRIPT reminds you of
NOVEL: a manuscript could be an unpublished novel. However, a REVIEW is not
part of a manuscript. Whereas, an EXCERPT is part of a NOVEL. (What is the
other eye-catcher in this problem?) <strong>The answer is
(C).</strong></div>

<p><strong>In Hard Problems, Eliminate any Answer-Choice
That Reminds You of the Original Pair.</strong></p>

<p>Eye-catchers are sometimes the answer to easy problems;
rarely are they the answer to medium problems; and virtually never are they the
answer to hard problems. When an average student guesses on a hard problem he
chooses an answer that reminds him of the original pair. But if the eye-catcher
were the answer, then the average student would get the problem correct and
therefore it would not be a hard problem.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong><br>
<strong>EXORCISM : DEMON ::</strong><div
class="options"><ol
id="list3"><li><p>matriculation
: induction</p></li><li><p>banishment : member</p></li><li><p>qualm
: angel</p></li><li><p>heuristic : method</p></li><li><p>manifesto
: spirit</p></li></ol></div><div id="solution"><span
class="solution">Solution:</span>

This is a hard problem. Hence, eliminate any answer-choice
that reminds you (however vaguely) of DEMON. A DEMON is a SPIRIT. So eliminate
choice (E). Next, choice (C) is not strictly speaking an eye-catcher. But an
ANGEL does remind one of a DEMON, and this is a hard problem. So eliminate
choice (C). Now, to EXORCISE a DEMON means to drive it away. Similarly, to a
BANISH a MEMBER of a group means to drive him or her away. <strong>The
answer is (B).</strong></div>
