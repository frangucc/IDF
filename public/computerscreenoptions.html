	<h1>Computer Screen Options</h1>

<p>When taking the test, you will have six on-screen options/buttons:</p>

<p>Quit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm</p>

<p>Unless you just cannot stand it any longer, never select Quit or Section. If you finish a section early, just relax while the time runs out. If youâ€™re not pleased with your performance on the test, you can always cancel it at the end.</p>
<p>The Time button allows you to display or hide the time. During the last five minutes, the time display cannot be hidden and it will also display the seconds remaining.
</p>

<p>The Help button will present a short tutorial showing how to use the program.
</p>
<p>You select an answer-choice by clicking the small oval next to it.

</p>

<p>To go to the next question, click the Next button. You will then be asked to confirm your answer by clicking the Confirm button. Then the next question will be presented.
